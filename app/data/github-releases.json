It's important to note [our old frameworks (such as GOV.UK Elements)](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/v4/migrating-from-legacy-products/) are no longer compatible with this release. It also stops Internet Explorer 11 from running GOV.UK Frontend JavaScript and removes support completely for Internet Explorer 8 to 10.\r\n\r\nYour service will not stop working in Internet Explorer 11, but components will look and behave differently without JavaScript. Read more about [how we provide support for different browsers](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/browser-support/).\r\n\r\nService teams should be [using a progressive enhancement approach](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/using-progressive-enhancement) to make sure users can still access any content and complete their tasks.\r\n\r\nIf you still need to provide support for older versions of Internet Explorer, you should stay on the latest [GOV.UK Frontend v4 release](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases).\r\n\r\nIf you need it, we have a checklist for the changes you might need to make for v5, which you can [view](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qt-9kLcB_ONp4WOTI61i69P3q7Ymw0ziA5YNUqNkImE/edit) or [copy (needs a Google account)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Qt-9kLcB_ONp4WOTI61i69P3q7Ymw0ziA5YNUqNkImE/copy).\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\nYou must make the following changes when you migrate to this release, or your service might break.\r\n\r\n### Update package file paths for Sass\r\n\r\nIn preparation for additional build targets, we've moved our package files into a directory called `dist`.\r\n\r\nReplace `govuk-frontend/govuk` with `govuk-frontend/dist/govuk` in any [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) `@import` paths.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/all\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you've added [`node_modules/govuk-frontend` as a Sass import path](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#simplify-sass-import-paths), update it with the `/dist` suffix:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nloadPaths: [\r\n  'node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist'\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're building your Sass code through Rails Assets Pipeline or Sprockets, refer to the section 'Update package file paths in Rails Assets Pipeline or Sprockets'.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [detailed guidance on importing using Sass](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#import-using-sass).\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in [#3498: Remove built `dist` and `package` from source](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3498)\r\n\r\n### Update package file paths for Nunjucks\r\n\r\nIn preparation for additional build targets, we've moved our package files into a directory called `dist`.\r\n\r\nReplace `govuk-frontend` with `govuk-frontend/dist` in any [`nunjucks.configure()`](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/api.html#configure) search paths:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnunjucks.configure([\r\n  'node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist'\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\nRefer to the [detailed guidance on using Nunjucks](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/use-nunjucks/#set-up-nunjucks-and-use-the-page-template).\r\n\r\nThese changes were made in the following pull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#3491: Update Review app to import `govuk-frontend` via local package](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3491)\r\n- [#3498: Remove built `dist` and `package` from source](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3498)\r\n\r\n### Update package file paths for assets such as images and fonts \r\n\r\nIn preparation for additional build targets, we've moved our package files into a directory called `dist`.\r\n\r\nIf you're [serving the assets from the GOV.UK Frontend assets folder](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/v4/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#serve-the-assets-from-the-gov-uk-frontend-assets-folder-recommended) (`node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/assets`), [update your routing to the new assets path ](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#serve-the-assets-from-the-gov-uk-frontend-assets-folder-recommended): `node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/assets`.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [detailed guidance on importing assets](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#font-and-image-assets).\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in [#3498: Remove built `dist` and `package` from source](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3498)\r\n\r\n### Update package file paths in Rails Assets Pipeline or Sprockets\r\n\r\nIn preparation for additional build targets, we've moved our package files into a directory called `dist`.\r\n\r\nUpdate the  `node_modules/govuk-frontend` part of the path to `node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist`, if you've added the path to GOV.UK Frontend package inside `node_modules` to:\r\n\r\n- [Rails Assets Pipeline search path](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/asset_pipeline.html#search-paths) using `Rails.application.config.assets.paths`\r\n- Sprockets using `append_path`\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in [#3498: Remove built `dist` and `package` from source](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3498)\r\n\r\n### Update package file paths if including JavaScript directly\r\n\r\nIn preparation for additional build targets, we've moved our package files into a directory called `dist`.\r\n\r\nIf you've [set up your routing to serve GOV.UK Frontend's `all.js` file from `node_modules`](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/v4/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#add-the-javascript-file-to-your-html), update the path you're serving to `node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/govuk-frontend.min.js`.\r\n\r\nUpdate any `<script>` tag with the new path and filename, if necessary. Make sure they have a `type=\"module\"` attribute. For example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"{path-to-javascript}/govuk-frontend.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace `<script>window.GOVUKFrontend.initAll()</script>` to import and initialise GOV.UK Frontend using ES modules:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"module\">\r\n  import { initAll } from '{path-to-javascript}/govuk-frontend.min.js'\r\n\r\n  initAll()\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nRefer to the [detailed guidance on importing JavaScript](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#add-the-javascript-file-to-your-html).\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in [#3498: Remove built `dist` and `package` from source](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3498)\r\n\r\n### Update package file paths for Node.js and other bundlers\r\n\r\nIn preparation for additional build targets, we've moved our package files into a directory called `dist`.\r\n\r\nIf you're importing GOV.UK Frontend using `import ... from 'govuk-frontend'` or `require('govuk-frontend')`, you have nothing to change.\r\n\r\nIf you're using `import` to import individual components, replace `govuk-frontend/govuk` with `govuk-frontend/dist/govuk`. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport Button from 'govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/components/button/button.mjs'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using `require` to import individual components, replace `govuk-frontend/govuk` with `govuk-frontend/dist/govuk` and update the file name to `<COMPONENT_NAME>.bundle.js`. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Button  =  require('govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/components/button/button.bundle.js')\r\n```\r\n\r\nRefer to the [detailed guidance on importing JavaScript](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#import-javascript-using-a-bundler).\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in [#3498: Remove built `dist` and `package` from source](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3498)\r\n\r\n### Verify your code does not rely on polyfills we have now removed\r\n\r\nWe have removed polyfills for Internet Explorer 8 to 11:\r\n\r\n- `DOMTokenList`, `Element.prototype.classList`, `Element.prototype.closest`, `Element.prototype.matches`, and `Event` - required for Internet Explorer 11 and below\r\n- `Element.prototype.dataset` - required for Internet Explorer 10 and below\r\n- `Date.now`, `Document`, `Element`, `Element.prototype.nextElementSibling`, `Element.prototype.previousElementSibling`, `Function.prototype.bind`, `Object.defineProperty`, `String.prototype.trim` and `Window` - required for Internet Explorer 8\r\n\r\nHowever, because these polyfills create or extend global objects ('polluting the global namespace'), you might have other code in your service unintentionally relying on the inclusion of these polyfills. You might need to introduce your own polyfills or rewrite your JavaScript to avoid using the polyfilled features.\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in [pull request #3570: Remove Internet Explorer 8 to 10 JavaScript polyfills, helpers, config](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3570)\r\n\r\n### Stop Internet Explorer 11 and other older browsers running unsupported JavaScript\r\n\r\nAdd `type=\"module\"` to all HTML `<script>` tags that include or bundle GOV.UK Frontend.\r\n\r\nThis is to stop Internet Explorer 11 and other older browsers running the JavaScript, which relies on features older browsers might not support and could cause errors.\r\n\r\nPlease note that `<script>` with `type=\"module\"` [runs JavaScript in a slightly different way](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#other_differences_between_modules_and_standard_scripts) than `<script>` without `type=\"module\". You'll need to assess the impact of these nuances and make sure that:\r\n\r\n- when your service code is bundled with GOV.UK Frontend it runs as expected in [strict mode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)\r\n- if you have any code that needs to run after [GOV.UK](http://gov.uk) Frontend in its own `<script>` tag, you'll need to make sure it's using `type=\"module\"` or [`defer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#defer). This is because the tag loading [GOV.UK](http://gov.uk) Frontend will be deferred because of its `type=\"module\"` attribute\r\n- code that needs to run without being deferred, is split into its own file and loaded with a `<script>` tag without `type=\"module\"`\r\n\r\nIf your service has JavaScript you want to run successfully in Internet Explorer (for example JavaScript for analytics), you will need to load it in a separate `<script>` tag without `type=\"module\"` and make sure its code is compatible with the browsers it should run in (see previous section about polyfills).\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in [pull request #3720: Remove IE11 vendor polyfills](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3720)\r\n\r\n### Update the <script> snippet at the top of your `<body>` tag\r\n\r\nPage templates now include a new `govuk-frontend-supported` class on the `<body>` tag when GOV.UK Frontend JavaScript components are fully supported.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using our Nunjucks page template, replace the existing snippet:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<script>document.body.className = ((document.body.className) ? document.body.className + ' js-enabled' : 'js-enabled');</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<script>document.body.className += ' js-enabled' + ('noModule' in HTMLScriptElement.prototype ? ' govuk-frontend-supported' : '');</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in [pull request #3801:\r\n\r\nAdd class .govuk-frontend-supported for ES modules support] (<https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3801>)\r\n\r\n### Update the hash used by your Content Security Policy\r\n\r\nIf your [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) uses a hash to let the snippet above run, you'll need to update it from:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsha256-+6WnXIl4mbFTCARd8N3COQmT3bJJmo32N8q8ZSQAIcU=\r\n```\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsha256-GUQ5ad8JK5KmEWmROf3LZd9ge94daqNvd8xy9YS1iDw=\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in [pull request #3801:\r\n\r\nAdd class .govuk-frontend-supported for ES modules support] (<https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3801>)\r\n\r\n### Remove calls to component `init` methods from your JavaScript\r\n\r\nIf you instantiate individual components, remove any calls to component `init` methods,  as initialisation now happens automatically. If you initialise the JavaScript using `window.GOVUKFrontend.initAll()`, you will not need to make any changes.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew Radios($radio).init()\r\n```\r\n\r\nbecomes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew Radios($radio)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #4011: Remove component init() methods and initialise in constructor](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4011).\r\n\r\n### Remove Internet Explorer 8 stylesheets, settings and mixins\r\n\r\nWe no longer support Internet Explorer 8 (IE8) in GOV.UK Frontend or provide dedicated stylesheets for the browser. Remove any references to these stylesheets from your HTML.\r\n\r\nWe've removed the `govuk-if-ie8` and `govuk-not-ie8` mixins, and the `$govuk-is-ie8` and `$govuk-ie8-breakpoint` settings. These were deprecated in [GOV.UK Frontend v4.6.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.6.0).\r\n\r\nYou should:\r\n\r\n- remove calls to the `govuk-if-ie8` mixin entirely (because the code passed to the mixin was only ever for Internet Explorer 8)\r\n- replace calls to the `govuk-not-ie8` mixin with the contents that were previously passed to the mixin (because now we always want the code passed to the mixin)\r\n- verify your codebase no longer uses these mixins and variables\r\n- remove `ie8` from the `$govuk-suppressed-warnings` list, if present\r\n\r\nIf a library you depend on is not yet updated and relies on these mixins and variables, as a temporary workaround you can define the following mixins and variables before importing:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n$govuk-is-ie8: false;\r\n$govuk-ie8-breakpoint: ('desktop');\r\n@mixin govuk-if-ie8 {\r\n  @if false {\r\n    @content;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n@mixin govuk-not-ie8 {@content}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3559: Remove IE8-related Sass and CSS build tasks](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3559).\r\n\r\n### Remove references to \"Compatibility mode\" and related features from your Sass\r\n\r\nGOV.UK Frontend is no longer compatible with [our old frameworks](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/v4/migrating-from-legacy-products/):\r\n\r\n- GOV.UK Elements\r\n- GOV.UK Template\r\n- GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit.\r\n\r\nYou cannot migrate an existing service to GOV.UK Frontend v5.0 if it is still using one of these frameworks -- you'll need to remain on the latest v4.x release until you've finished the migration. Remove any references to these Sass variables and mixins:\r\n\r\n- `$govuk-compatibility-govukelements`\r\n- `$govuk-compatibility-govuktemplate`\r\n- `$govuk-compatibility-govukfrontendtoolkit`\r\n\r\n- the `govuk-compatibility` mixin which could be used to conditionally output CSS when compatibility mode was enabled\r\n- remove `compatibility-mode` from the `$govuk-suppressed-warnings` list, if present\r\n\r\nWe've additionally removed features that were managed using the above variables. We've removed the following features and their corresponding variables:\r\n\r\n- access to the legacy colour palette using `$govuk-use-legacy-palette`\r\n- access to the legacy font using `$govuk-use-legacy-font`\r\n- use of legacy tabular fonts using `$govuk-font-family-tabular`\r\n- the ability to not use rem font sizes using `$govuk-typography-use-rem`\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in:\r\n\r\n- [pull request #3622: Remove compatibility mode variables](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3622)\r\n- [pull request #3602: Remove compatibility-mode mixin](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3602)\r\n- [pull request #3576: Remove legacy colour palette](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3576)\r\n- [pull request #3574: Remove legacy and tabular fonts support](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3574)\r\n- [pull request #3576: Remove $govuk-typography-use-rem setting](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3575)\r\n\r\n### Remove references to font family variables from your Sass\r\n\r\nRemove any references to following Sass variables:\r\n\r\n- `$govuk-font-family-gds-transport`\r\n- `$govuk-font-family-nta`\r\n- `$govuk-font-family-nta-tabular`\r\n\r\nIf you were using `$govuk-font-family-gds-transport` to set the font on an element, we recommend using [the `govuk-font` mixin](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/sass-api-reference/#govuk-font) instead.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3949: Simplify font family settings](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3949).\r\n\r\n### Remove references to `govuk-button--disabled` class from the HTML for the Button component\r\n\r\nFor the [Button component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/), remove any references to the `govuk-button--disabled` class that we deprecated in [GOV.UK Frontend v4.6.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.6.0).\r\n\r\nUse the `disabled` attribute to mark `<button>` and `<input>` elements as being disabled instead.\r\n\r\nWe no longer support link buttons being disabled or using disabled styles.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3557: Remove deprecated `govuk-button--disabled` class](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3557).\r\n\r\n### Remove references to the JavaScript for the Details component\r\n\r\nThe [Details component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/details/) no longer uses JavaScript, and is no longer polyfilled in older browsers.\r\n\r\nIf you are importing the JavaScript for this component individually, remove any references to it.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using our Nunjucks macros, remove the `data-module=\"govuk-details\"` attribute from all `<details>` elements.\r\n\r\nWe've styled the details component so content does not look 'broken' in browsers that do not support it. If your service supports these browsers,  you will need to add your own polyfills.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in:\r\n\r\n- [pull request #3766: Remove JavaScript from Details component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3766).\r\n- [pull request #3758: Style details in older browsers](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3758)\r\n\r\n### Update the GOV.UK logo\r\n\r\nWe've updated the GOV.UK logo to merge the GOV.UK text with the crown graphic. This is to make sure the full logo is always rendered correctly even if parts of the page, such as CSS or the Transport webfont, fail to load. We've also modified styles relating to the logo.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the `govukHeader` Nunjucks macro you don't need to change anything.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, to update to the new logo:\r\n\r\n- remove `<span class=\"govuk-header__logotype-text\">` and its content\r\n- remove the `<span class=\"govuk-header__logotype\">` around the svg element\r\n- replace the svg element with [this updated SVG](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/70be4b7fcaed406c4aeaf9618da52de1b3ff02db/packages/govuk-frontend/src/govuk/components/header/template.njk#L14-L26), and make sure you also update the class name and attributes\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #4449: Implement transitional crown in the Header component (v5.0)](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4449).\r\n\r\n### Check your favicons, app icons and OpenGraph image still work\r\n\r\nWe've changed the names, formats and sizes of icon assets we distribute in Frontend. You will want to check that the correct files are copied in the right place and served at the right URLs.\r\n\r\nThe following files have been added to the assets folder:\r\n\r\n- manifest.json\r\n- images/favicon.svg\r\n- images/govuk-icon-180.png\r\n- images/govuk-icon-192.png\r\n- images/govuk-icon-512.png\r\n- images/govuk-icon-mask.svg\r\n\r\nThe following files have been removed from the assets folder:\r\n\r\n- images/govuk-apple-touch-icon.png\r\n- images/govuk-apple-touch-icon-152x152.png\r\n- images/govuk-apple-touch-icon-167x167.png\r\n- images/govuk-apple-touch-icon-180x180.png\r\n- images/govuk-mask-icon.svg\r\n\r\nIf you're not using the Nunjucks page template, you will need to replace the list of icons in the template's head with the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"icon\" sizes=\"48x48\" href=\"/assets/images/favicon.ico\">\r\n<link rel=\"icon\" sizes=\"any\" href=\"/assets/images/favicon.svg\" type=\"image/svg+xml\">\r\n<link rel=\"mask-icon\" href=\"/assets/images/govuk-icon-mask.svg\" color=\"#0b0c0c\">\r\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"/assets/images/govuk-icon-180.png\">\r\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/assets/manifest.json\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will need to update the file path to match your assets folder if it's not at the default location.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #4445: Implement transitional crown favicons (v5.0)](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4445).\r\n\r\n### Remove the fallback GOV.UK crown logo from the  HTML for the Header component\r\n\r\nThe [Header component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/) previously included a fallback PNG version of the GOV.UK crown logo for Internet Explorer 8. As Frontend no longer supports Internet Explorer 8, we've removed this fallback.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using the Nunjucks macros, you'll need to remove this fallback from your HTML code. In your Header component:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the block of HTML containing the `govuk-header__logotype-crown-fallback-image` image, starting with `<!--[if IE 8]>` and ending with `<![endif]-->`.\r\n2. Remove `<!--[if gt IE 8]><!-->` and  `<!--<![endif]-->` from around the `govuk-header__logotype-crown` SVG, but don't remove the SVG.\r\n3. Delete the `govuk-logotype-crown.png` file from your assets folder.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to change any HTML if you're using the supplied Nunjucks macros, but you might still need to remove the `govuk-logotype-crown.png` image depending on [how you are serving the font and image assets](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#font-and-image-assets).\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3641: Remove fallback GOV.UK logo for IE8](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3641).\r\n\r\n### Remove references to `govuk-header__navigation--no-service-name` class from the HTML for the Header component\r\n\r\nWe've removed the `govuk-header__navigation--no-service-name` class which we deprecated in [GOV.UK Frontend v4.3.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.3.0).\r\n\r\nWe no longer supply a dedicated class for headers with navigation but no service name. If you still need this feature, you can reproduce it in your own code using the `govuk-spacing` Sass mixin.\r\n\r\nYou could:\r\n\r\n- add a new `app-header-navigation` class to the header's `<nav>` tag (you can use the `navigationClasses` option for the Header component if you're using Nunjucks)\r\n- add the following styles for this class in your Sass:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.app-header-navigation {\r\n    padding-top: govuk-spacing(7);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3595: Remove deprecated `govuk-header__navigation--no-service-name` class](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3595).\r\n\r\n### Add the `hidden` attribute to the mobile menu button in the Header component\r\n\r\nWe've removed some styles from the `govuk-header__menu-button` class. These styles were included on the [mobile menu button](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/#header-with-service-name-and-navigation) to avoid introducing a breaking change in [GOV.UK Frontend v4.3.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.3.0).\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Nunjucks macros, and have not done so already, add the `hidden` attribute to the button's HTML to ensure it continues working as expected.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to make any changes if using the Nunjucks macro.\r\n\r\nWhen working correctly, the button should only show on narrow screens when JavaScript is available. It should be hidden on wider screens or if JavaScript is unavailable.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3596: Remove redundant display style from `govuk-header__menu-button`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3596).\r\n\r\n### Update references to `govuk-header__link--service-name` class from the HTML for the Header component\r\n\r\nWe've removed the `govuk-header__link--service-name` class which we deprecated in [GOV.UK Frontend v4.2.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.2.0).\r\n\r\nUse the `govuk-header__service-name` class instead.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3594: Remove deprecated `govuk-header__link--service-name` class](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3594).\r\n\r\n### Update references to `govuk-!-margin-static` and `govuk-!-padding-static classes` from the HTML\r\n\r\nWe've removed the override classes starting with `govuk-!-margin-static` and `govuk-!-padding-static`, which were deprecated in [GOV.UK Frontend v4.3.1](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.3.1).\r\n\r\nUse the classes starting with `govuk-!-static-margin` and `govuk-!-static-padding` instead.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3593: Remove deprecated static spacing classes](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3593).\r\n\r\n### Update references to the `govuk-warning-text__assistive` class  from the HTML for the Warning Text component\r\n\r\nFor the [Warning Text component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/warning-text/), we've removed the `govuk-warning-text__assistive` class and its styles from GOV.UK Frontend. This class is unnecessary, as it duplicates the functionality of the `govuk-visually-hidden` class already present in Frontend.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Nunjucks macros, update your warning text HTML to replace the `govuk-warning-text__assistive` class with the `govuk-visually-hidden` class.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3569: Remove unnecessary class from Warning Text component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3569).\r\n\r\n### Check your browser console for component initialisation errors\r\n\r\nGOV.UK Frontend JavaScript components now provide errors if you initialise a component incorrectly.\r\n\r\nThese errors will be:\r\n\r\n- logged in the browser console when using the `initAll()` function\r\n- [thrown as exceptions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw) when [instantiating components individually](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#select-and-initialise-an-individual-component)\r\n\r\nTo make sure the components behave as intended, we encourage you to check your browser console and address any errors by updating your markup or configuration.\r\n\r\nErrors you might see include:\r\n\r\n- `SupportError` - when GOV.UK Frontend is not supported in the current browser\r\n- `ElementError` - when component templates have missing or broken HTML elements\r\n- `ConfigError` - when component JavaScript configuration does not match our documentation\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in:\r\n\r\n- [pull request #4030: Throw `SupportError` when instantiating components where GOV.UK Frontend is not supported](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4030)\r\n- [pull request #4104: Throw `ElementError` when the module is not of the expected type](<[https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4104](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4104)>))\r\n- [pull request #4177: Add `MissingElementError` and use it within the Skip Link](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4177)\r\n- [pull request #4199: Throw `ElementError` when \"Exit this page\" button is missing](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4199)\r\n- [pull request #4206: Throw `ElementError` when the menu of the header is missing but a toggle is present](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4206)\r\n- [pull request #4236: Throw `ElementError` for missing elements during Character count instantiation](<[https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4236](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4236)>))\r\n- [pull request #4261: Throw `ElementError` for missing elements during Character count instantiation](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4261)\r\n- [pull request #4266: Throw errors during accordion initialisation](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4266)\r\n- [pull request #4176: Throw `ConfigError` when component configs are invalid](<[https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4176](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4176)>))\r\n\r\n### Check any JavaScript that uses `HTMLElement.getAttribute` to get the disabled state of a button works as expected\r\n\r\nThe `disabled` attribute on 'Disabled buttons' created using our Nunjucks macros no longer includes a value.\r\n\r\nIf you are using `$button.getAttribute('disabled')` to check for the disabled attribute in JavaScript, this will now return an empty string. This might cause unexpected behaviour if you are relying on the return value being the string 'disabled' or being [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy).\r\n\r\nInstead, we recommend checking for the `disabled` attribute using [`$button.hasAttribute('disabled')`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/hasAttribute) or the [`$button.disabled` IDL attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLButtonElement/disabled).\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2830: Set the boolean disabled attribute consistently in the Button component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2830).\r\n\r\n### Check that inverse buttons still look as expected if you have customised the brand colour\r\n\r\n[Inverse button components](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/#buttons-on-dark-backgrounds) now use the `$govuk-brand-colour` setting to determine the button's text colour and the button's background tint when hovered or activated. The button will only look different if `$govuk-brand-colour` has been changed from the default.\r\n\r\nYou can restore the previous blue colour by setting `$govuk-inverse-button-text-colour` before importing the button component's Sass.\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/base\";\r\n\r\n$govuk-inverse-button-text-colour: govuk-colour(\"blue\");\r\n\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/components/button/index\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #4043: Add ability to customise inverse button colours](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4043).\r\n\r\n### Check any Selects that have options without explicit values work as expected\r\n\r\nThe `govukSelect` macro will no longer include an empty value attribute for options that do not have a value set.\r\n\r\nIf that option is selected, the value of the Select will become the text content of the option, rather than an empty string.\r\n\r\nIf you need to maintain the existing behaviour, you can set the value to an empty string.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3773: Omit the value attribute from select options with no value](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3773).\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n### Use the Task list component to give users an overview of the tasks they need to complete\r\n\r\nThe [Task list component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/task-list/) displays all the tasks a user needs to do, and allows users to easily identify which ones are done and which they still need to do.\r\n\r\nEach task in the list can have a title, status, link and an optional hint. When a link is added, the whole row is clickable.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2261: Task list component.](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2261).\r\n\r\n### Use the new focus style for links containing non-text content\r\n\r\nWe've added a new focus style for use with non-text content, such as links containing images and focusable elements that are not form controls. This new style paints a visible yellow and black outline around the entire element, ensuring the focus style is visible in all situations.\r\n\r\nFor links containing images, we've added the `govuk-link-image` class. You should only use this class on links containing an image. If it also contains text, continue to use `govuk-link` instead.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a class=\"govuk-link-image\" href=\"#\">\r\n  <img src=\"...\" alt=\"...\">\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use these styles in your own code by including the `govuk-focused-box` Sass mixin.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3819: Add linked image focus style](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3819).\r\n\r\n### New link styles are now enabled by default\r\n\r\nIn GOV.UK Frontend v3.12.0 we introduced new link styles which are now enabled by default. They have:\r\n\r\n- underlines that are consistently thinner and a bit further away from the link text\r\n- a clearer hover state, where the underline gets thicker to make the link stand out to users\r\n\r\nThe new link styles are now enabled by default. If you are setting `$govuk-new-link-styles` to `true` in your Sass you can now remove this.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in:\r\n\r\n- [pull request #3599: Enable new link styles by default](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3599)\r\n- [pull request #3600: Remove new link styles feature flag](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3600)\r\n\r\n### Customise the colours of inverse buttons\r\n\r\nFor non-GOV.UK branded websites, you can now change the colours of inverse buttons - buttons intended for use on dark backgrounds.\r\n\r\nTo change the inverse button's background colour, set the `$govuk-inverse-button-background-colour` Sass variable.\r\n\r\nTo change the inverse button's text colour, set the `$govuk-inverse-button-text-colour` Sass variable.\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/base\";\r\n\r\n$govuk-inverse-button-background-colour: govuk-colour(\"yellow\");\r\n$govuk-inverse-button-text-colour: govuk-colour(\"black\");\r\n\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/components/button/index\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #4043: Add ability to customise inverse button colours](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4043).\r\n\r\n### Precompiled CSS and JavaScript\r\n\r\nThe precompiled CSS and JavaScript files found in our [GitHub releases](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases) are now also published to [`govuk-frontend` on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/govuk-frontend).\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in:\r\n\r\n- [pull request #3726: Default to ES modules with single Rollup config](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3726)\r\n- [pull request #4241: Add new `govuk-frontend.min.css` package bundle](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4241)\r\n\r\n### Check your tags align with design changes to the Tag component\r\n\r\nWe've changed the design of the [Tag component](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/tag/) to improve accessibility and readability.\r\n\r\nText within the tag is no longer bold and uppercase with extra letter spacing. It's now regular 19px text with the first letter of a word capitalised and the rest of the content lowercase. Due to this, there might be changes to the width of existing tags.\r\n\r\nThe colours have also changed to make them more distinguishable from buttons.\r\n\r\nCheck your service is using the correct capitalisation in the contents of tags and tags within phase banners.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in:\r\n\r\n- [pull request #3502: Tag design changes](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3502)\r\n- [pull request #3731: Remove the first letter modifier from the tag component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3731)\r\n\r\n## Recommended changes\r\n\r\nWe've recently made some non-breaking changes to GOV.UK Frontend. Implementing these changes will make your service work better.\r\n\r\n### Remove the X-UA-Compatible meta tag\r\n\r\nRemove the <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\"> meta tag from your page template.\r\n\r\nInternet Explorer versions 8, 9 and 10 included a feature that would try to determine if the page was built for an older version of IE and would silently enable compatibility mode, which would modify the rendering engine's behaviour to match the older version of IE. Setting this meta tag prevented that behaviour.\r\n\r\nInternet Explorer 11 deprecated this meta tag and defaulted to always using IE11's renderer when the page has a HTML5 doctype (<!DOCTYPE html>).\r\n\r\nAs Frontend no longer supports Internet Explorer versions older than 11, you can now remove this meta tag.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #4434: Remove X-UA-Compatible meta tag](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4434).\r\n\r\n### Update the Pagination component's default `aria-label`\r\n\r\nWe've updated the default value of the [Pagination component's](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/pagination/) `aria-label` to be more descriptive of the contents of the region. If you're using the component's default label, you might wish to update it to the new default of 'Pagination'.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to change anything if you're using the `govukPagination` Nunjucks macro.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3899: Update default `aria-label` in Pagination component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3899).\r\n\r\n### Update the Exit this Page button's default text\r\n\r\nWe've updated the default text of the Exit this Page button. It now includes visually-hidden text to clarify that the button is a safety tool and not a generic method of leaving the current page.\r\n\r\nIf you are using the component's default text, you might wish to update it to the new value: `<span class=\"govuk-visually-hidden\">Emergency</span> Exit this page`\r\n\r\nYou do not need to change anything if you're using the `govukExitThisPage` Nunjucks macro.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3989: Update default Exit This Page button text](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3989).\r\n\r\n### Add the `rel` attribute to the Exit this Page button and secondary link\r\n\r\nUpdate the Exit this Page button and secondary link to include a new attribute and value: `rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"`.\r\n\r\nAdding this attribute does 2 things:\r\n\r\n- it instructs search engines that your service does not endorse the external website for the purposes of determining search engine rankings\r\n- it instructs web browsers to not send information about your service to the external website\r\n\r\nThis fixes a potential risk where the external website could detect that a user had visited from a GOV.UK page and play that information back to the user, which could risk a user's personal safety in some contexts.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to change the Exit this Page button if you're using the `govukExitThisPage` Nunjucks macro. You will still have to update the secondary link manually.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #4054: Add `rel` attribute to the Exit this Page button](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4054). Thanks to [Greg Tyler](https://github.com/gregtyler) for reporting this issue.\r\n\r\n### Update titles of the action links inside the Summary Card\r\n\r\nIf you're not using our Nunjucks macro, we recommend you update the action links :\r\n\r\n- of the Summary Card (inside the element with the `govuk-summary-card__actions` class)\r\n- of the Summary List it contains (inside the element with the `govuk-summary-list__actions` class)\r\n\r\nYou'll need to either:\r\n\r\n- append a visually hidden `<span>` with the title of the card, if there's none already\r\n- or append the title of card to the existing visually hidden span, if there was one already\r\n\r\nThe final link should be structured as such:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n\r\n<a class=\"govuk-link <EXISTING_CLASSES>\" <EXISTING_ATTRIBUTES>>\r\n  <EXISTING_VISIBLE_TITLE>\r\n  <span class=\"govuk-visually-hidden\">\r\n    <EXISTING_HIDDEN_TEXT_IF_PRESENT>\r\n    <SUMMARY_CARD_TITLE>\r\n  </span>\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is to make sure each link has a unique accessible name, which will help users of assistive technology distinguish them from one another.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3961: Append card title to action links inside of a Summary Card](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3961).\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\nWe've made fixes to GOV.UK Frontend in the following pull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#3777: Fix hover style on small checkboxes and radio buttons in High Contrast Mode](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3777)\r\n- [#3791: Refactor mobile menu button label/text handling](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3791)\r\n- [#3862: Fix focus style being overlapped by summary action links](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3862)\r\n- [#4113: Always set an explicit button `type`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4113)\r\n- [#4267: Remove unnecessary duplicated use of govuk-font](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4267)\r\n- [#4268: Allow border and hover colours to be overridden](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4268)\r\n- [#4327: Fix Nunjucks default() values when null, false or \"\" is provided](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4327)\r\n- [#4416: Review and fix HTML attribute trailing spaces etc](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4416)\r\n- [#4450: Update descriptions for Nunjucks macro options + fixes](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4450)\r\n\r\n## Thank you\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone who contributed to the GOV.UK Design System 👏👏👏.

This is to ensure that the full logo is always rendered correctly even if parts of the page, such as CSS or the Transport webfont fail to load. Styles relating to the logo have also been modified.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the `govukHeader` Nunjucks macro you don't need to change anything.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, to update to the new logo:\r\n\r\n1. Remove `<span class=\"govuk-header__logotype-text\">` and its content.\r\n2. Remove the `<span class=\"govuk-header__logotype\">` around the `svg` element.\r\n3. Replace the `svg` element with [this updated SVG](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/06e6a56655f458112363423dc8f1fb50d21b225e/packages/govuk-frontend/src/govuk/components/header/template.njk#L14-L25), ensuring that the class name and attributes are also updated.\r\n\r\nThis change was made in [pull request #4449: Implement transitional crown in the Header component (v5.0)](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4449).\r\n\r\n### Check your favicons, app icons and OpenGraph image still work\r\n\r\nWe've changed the names, formats and sizes of icon assets that we distribute in Frontend. You will want to check that the correct files are in place.\r\n\r\nThe following files have been added to the assets folder:\r\n\r\n- manifest.json\r\n- images/favicon.svg\r\n- images/govuk-icon-180.png\r\n- images/govuk-icon-192.png\r\n- images/govuk-icon-512.png\r\n- images/govuk-icon-mask.svg\r\n\r\nThe following files have been removed from the assets folder:\r\n\r\n- images/govuk-apple-touch-icon.png\r\n- images/govuk-apple-touch-icon-152x152.png\r\n- images/govuk-apple-touch-icon-167x167.png\r\n- images/govuk-apple-touch-icon-180x180.png\r\n- images/govuk-mask-icon.svg\r\n\r\nIf you're not using the Nunjucks page template, you will need to replace the list of icons in the template's `head` with the following:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"icon\" sizes=\"48x48\" href=\"/assets/images/favicon.ico\">\r\n<link rel=\"icon\" sizes=\"any\" href=\"/assets/images/favicon.svg\" type=\"image/svg+xml\">\r\n<link rel=\"mask-icon\" href=\"/assets/images/govuk-icon-mask.svg\" color=\"#0b0c0c\">\r\n<link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"/assets/images/govuk-icon-180.png\">\r\n<link rel=\"manifest\" href=\"/assets/manifest.json\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will need to update the file path to match your assets folder if it's not at the default location.\r\n\r\nThis change was made in [pull request #4445: Implement transitional crown favicons (v5.0)](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4445).\r\n\r\n## Recommended changes\r\n\r\nWe've recently made some non-breaking changes to GOV.UK Frontend. Implementing these changes will make your service work better.\r\n\r\n### Remove the X-UA-Compatible meta tag\r\n\r\nRemove the `<meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\">` meta tag from your page template.\r\n\r\nInternet Explorer versions 8, 9 and 10 included a feature that would try to determine if the page was built for an older version of IE and would silently enable compatibility mode, which would modify the rendering engine's behaviour to match the older version of IE. Setting this meta tag prevented that behaviour.\r\n\r\nIE11 deprecated this meta tag and defaulted to always using IE11's renderer when the page has a HTML5 doctype (`<!DOCTYPE html>`).\r\n\r\nAs Frontend no longer supports Internet Explorer versions older than 11, this meta tag can now be removed.\r\n\r\nThis change was made in [pull request #4434: Remove X-UA-Compatible meta tag](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4434).\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\nWe’ve made fixes to GOV.UK Frontend in the following pull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#4416: Review and fix HTML attribute

New features\r\n\r\n### Added a new Task list component\r\n\r\nWe’ve added a new component which creates lists of tasks that users need to complete.\r\n\r\nEach task in the list can have a title, status, link and an optional hint. When a link is added, the whole row is clickable.\r\n\r\nThis change was made in [pull request #2261: Task list component.](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2261).\r\n\r\n### Added focus style for links containing non-text content\r\n\r\nWe've added a new focus style for use with non-text content, such as links containing images and focusable elements that are not form controls. This new style paints a visible yellow and black outline around the entire element, ensuring the focus style is visible in all situations.\r\n\r\nFor links containing images, we've added the `govuk-link-image` class. You should only use this class on links containing an image. If it also contains text, continue to use `govuk-link` instead.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<a class=\"govuk-link-image\" href=\"#\">\r\n  <img src=\"...\" alt=\"...\">\r\n</a>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use these styles in your own code by including the `govuk-focused-box` Sass mixin.\r\n\r\nThis change was made in [pull request #3819: Add linked image focus style](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3819).\r\n\r\n### New link styles are now enabled by default\r\n\r\nIn GOV.UK Frontend v3.12.0 we introduced new link styles which are now enabled by default. They have:\r\n\r\nunderlines that are consistently thinner and a bit further away from the link text\r\na clearer hover state, where the underline gets thicker to make the link stand out to users\r\n\r\nThe new link styles are now enabled by default. If you are setting `$govuk-new-link-styles` to `true` in your Sass you can now remove this.\r\n\r\nThis change was made in:\r\n\r\n- [pull request #3599: Enable new link styles by default](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3599)\r\n- [pull request #3600: Remove new link styles feature flag](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3600)\r\n\r\n### Customise inverse button colours\r\n\r\nFor non-GOV.UK branded websites, you can now change the colours of inverse buttons - buttons intended for use on dark backgrounds.\r\n\r\nTo change the inverse button's background colour, set the `$govuk-inverse-button-background-colour` Sass variable.\r\n\r\nTo change the inverse button's text colour, set the `$govuk-inverse-button-text-colour` Sass variable.\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/base\";\r\n\r\n$govuk-inverse-button-background-colour: govuk-colour(\"yellow\");\r\n$govuk-inverse-button-text-colour: govuk-colour(\"black\");\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/components/button/index\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was made in [pull request #4043: Add ability to customise inverse button colours](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4043).\r\n\r\n### Precompiled CSS and JavaScript\r\n\r\nThe precompiled CSS and JavaScript files found in our [GitHub releases](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases) are now also published to [`govuk-frontend` on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/govuk-frontend).\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in:\r\n\r\n- [pull request #3726: Default to ES modules with single Rollup config](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3726)\r\n- [pull request #4241: Add new `govuk-frontend.min.css` package bundle](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4241)\r\n\r\n### Check your tags align with design changes to the Tag component\r\n\r\nWe’ve changed the design of the tag component to improve accessibility and readability.\r\n\r\nText within the tag is no longer bold and uppercase with extra letter spacing. It’s now regular 19px text with the first letter of a word capitalised and the rest of the content lowercase. Due to this, there might be changes to the width of existing tags.\r\n\r\nThe colours have also changed to make them more distinguishable from buttons.\r\n\r\nCheck your service is using the correct capitalisation in the contents of tags and tags within phase banners.\r\n\r\nThis change was made in:\r\n\r\n- [pull request #3502: Tag design changes](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3502)\r\n- [pull request #3731: Remove the first letter modifier from the tag component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3731)\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\n\r\nYou must make the following changes when you migrate to this release, or your service might break.\r\n\r\n### \"Compatibility mode\" features are no longer supported\r\n\r\nGOV.UK Frontend no longer supports compatibility with our old frameworks:\r\n\r\n- GOV.UK Elements\r\n- GOV.UK Template\r\n- GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit.\r\n\r\nYou can no longer incrementally add GOV.UK Frontend to an existing service using one of these previous frameworks. We have removed the following Sass variables and one mixin which controlled compatibility mode:\r\n\r\n- `$govuk-compatibility-govukelements`\r\n- `$govuk-compatibility-govuktemplate`\r\n- `$govuk-compatibility-govukfrontendtoolkit`\r\n- the `compatibility-mode` mixin which automatically checked if any of the 3 control variables were set to `true`\r\n\r\nWe’ve additionally removed features that were managed using the above variables. The following features and their corresponding variables have now been removed:\r\n\r\n- access to the legacy colour palette using `$govuk-use-legacy-palette`\r\n- access to the legacy font using `$govuk-use-legacy-font`\r\n- use of legacy tabular fonts using `$govuk-font-family-tabular`\r\n- the ability to not use rem font sizes using `$govuk-typography-use-rem`\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in:\r\n\r\n- [pull request #3622: Remove compatibility mode variables](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3622)\r\n- [pull request #3602: Remove compatibility-mode mixin](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3602)\r\n- [pull request #3576: Remove legacy colour palette](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3576)\r\n- [pull request #3574: Remove legacy and tabular fonts support](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3574)\r\n- [pull request #3576: Remove $govuk-typography-use-rem setting](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3575)\r\n\r\n### Update the HTML for warning text\r\n\r\nWe've removed the `.govuk-warning-text__assistive` class and its styles from GOV.UK Frontend. This class is unnecessary, as it duplicates the functionality of the `.govuk-visually-hidden` class already present in Frontend.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not using Nunjucks macros, update your warning text HTML to replace the `govuk-warning-text__assistive` class with the `govuk-visually-hidden` class.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3569: Remove unnecessary class from Warning Text component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3569).\r\n\r\n### Update package file paths\r\n\r\nIn preparation for additional build targets, we've moved our package files into a directory called `dist`.\r\n\r\n#### If you’re using Node.js and other bundlers\r\n\r\nReplace `govuk-frontend/govuk` with `govuk-frontend/dist/govuk` in any JavaScript `require()` or `import` file paths.\r\n\r\nFor example using `require()`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst Button = require('govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/components/button/button')\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example using `import`:\r\n\r\n```mjs\r\nimport Button from 'govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/components/button/button.mjs'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If you’re including JavaScript directly\r\n\r\nReplace GOV.UK Frontend `all.js` with `govuk-frontend.min.js` and use `<script type=\"module\">` for ES modules:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"module\" src=\"{path-to-javascript}/govuk-frontend.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext replace `<script>window.GOVUKFrontend.initAll()</script>` to import and initialise GOV.UK Frontend using ES modules:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"module\">\r\n  import { initAll } from '{path-to-javascript}/govuk-frontend.min.js'\r\n  initAll()\r\n</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you import JavaScript using a different method, you might need to make some changes.\r\n\r\nRefer to the [detailed guidance on importing JavaScript](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#javascript).\r\n\r\n#### If you’re using Sass\r\n\r\nReplace `govuk-frontend/govuk` with `govuk-frontend/dist/govuk` in any Sass `@import` paths.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist/govuk/all\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you’ve added [`node_modules/govuk-frontend` as a Sass import path](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#simplify-sass-import-paths), update it with the `/dist` suffix:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nloadPaths: [\r\n  'node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist'\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### If you’re using Nunjucks\r\n\r\nReplace `govuk-frontend` with `govuk-frontend/dist` in any [`nunjucks.configure()`](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/api.html#configure) search paths:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnunjucks.configure([\r\n  'node_modules/govuk-frontend/dist'\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese changes were made in the following pull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#3491: Update Review app to import `govuk-frontend` via local package](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3491)\r\n- [#3498: Remove built `dist` and `package` from source](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3498)\r\n\r\n### Update the `<script>` snippet at the top of your `<body>` tag\r\n\r\nPage templates now include a new `govuk-frontend-supported` class on the `<body>` tag when GOV.UK Frontend JavaScript components are fully supported.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using our [Nunjucks page template](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/page-template/), replace the existing snippet:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>document.body.className = ((document.body.className) ? document.body.className + ' js-enabled' : 'js-enabled');</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script>document.body.className += ' js-enabled' + ('noModule' in HTMLScriptElement.prototype ? ' govuk-frontend-supported' : '');</script>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Update the hash used by your Content Security Policy\r\n\r\nIf your Content Security Policy uses a hash to let the snippet above run, you'll need to update it from:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsha256-+6WnXIl4mbFTCARd8N3COQmT3bJJmo32N8q8ZSQAIcU=\r\n```\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsha256-GUQ5ad8JK5KmEWmROf3LZd9ge94daqNvd8xy9YS1iDw=\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Check your browser console for component initialisation errors\r\n\r\nGOV.UK Frontend JavaScript components now provide errors. The following list shows the type of errors and the situations in which they occur:\r\n\r\n- `SupportError` - when GOV.UK Frontend is not supported in the current browser\r\n- `ElementError` - when component templates have missing or broken HTML elements\r\n- `ConfigError` - when component JavaScript configuration does not match our documentation\r\n\r\nThese errors will be:\r\n\r\n- logged in the browser console when [using the `initAll()` function](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#add-the-javascript-file-to-your-html)\r\n- [thrown as exceptions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw) when [instantiating components individually](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#select-and-initialise-an-individual-component)\r\n\r\nTo make sure the components behave as intended, we encourage you to check your browser console and address any errors by updating your markup or configuration.\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in:\r\n\r\n- [pull request #4030: Throw `SupportError` when instantiating components where GOV.UK Frontend is not supported](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4030)\r\n- [pull request #4104: Throw `ElementError` when the module is not of the expected type](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4104)\r\n- [pull request #4176: Throw `ConfigError` when component configs are invalid](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4176)\r\n- [pull request #4177: Add `MissingElementError` and use it within the Skip Link](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4177)\r\n- [pull request #4199: Throw `ElementError` when \"Exit this page\" button is missing](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4199)\r\n- [pull request #4206: Throw `ElementError` when the menu of the header is missing but a toggle is present](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4206)\r\n- [pull request #4236: Throw `ElementError` (not found) if checkboxes or radios have no input items](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4236)\r\n- [pull request #4261: Throw `ElementError` for missing elements during Character count instantiation](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4261)\r\n- [pull request #4266: Throw errors during accordion initialisation](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4266)\r\n\r\n### Check the Details component works as expected\r\n\r\nThe Details component no longer uses JavaScript, and is no longer polyfilled in older browsers.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using our Nunjucks macros, make sure you remove the `data-module=\"govuk-details\"` attribute from all `<details>` elements.\r\n\r\nIf you have extended browser support requirements, check the Details component works as expected in older browsers.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3766: Remove JavaScript from Details component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3766).\r\n\r\n### Check the ‘Disabled buttons’ work as expected\r\n\r\nThe `disabled` attribute on ‘Disabled buttons’ created using our Nunjucks macros no longer includes a value.\r\n\r\nIf you are using `$button.getAttribute('disabled')` to check for the disabled attribute in JavaScript, this will now return an empty string. This might cause unexpected behaviour if you are relying on the return value being the string 'disabled' or being [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy).\r\n\r\nInstead, we recommend checking for the `disabled` attribute using [`$button.hasAttribute('disabled')`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/hasAttribute) or the [`$button.disabled` IDL attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLButtonElement/disabled).\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2830: Set the boolean disabled attribute consistently in the button component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2830).\r\n\r\n### Check the mobile menu button in the Header component works as expected\r\n\r\nWe've removed some styles from the `.govuk-header__menu-button` class. These styles were included on the mobile menu button to avoid introducing a breaking change in GOV.UK Frontend v4.3.0.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Nunjucks macros, and have not done so already, add the `hidden` attribute to the button's HTML to ensure it continues working as expected.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to make any changes if using the Nunjucks macro.\r\n\r\nWhen working correctly, the button should only show on narrow screens when JavaScript is available. It should be hidden on wider screens or if JavaScript is unavailable.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3596: Remove redundant display style from .govuk-header\\_\\_menu-button](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3596).\r\n\r\n### Check the Selects work as expected\r\n\r\nThe `govukSelect` macro will no longer include an empty value attribute for options that do not have a value set.\r\n\r\nThis means that the value of the select if that option is selected will now be the text content of the option, rather than an empty string.\r\n\r\nIf you need to maintain the existing behaviour, you can set the value to an empty string.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3773: Omit the value attribute from select options with no value](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3773).\r\n\r\n### Check that inverse buttons still look as expected\r\n\r\nInverse button components now use the `$govuk-brand-colour` setting to determine the button's text colour and the button's background tint when hovered or activated. The button will only look different if `$govuk-brand-colour` has been changed from the default.\r\n\r\nYou can restore the previous blue colour by setting `$govuk-inverse-button-text-colour` before importing the button component's Sass.\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/base\";\r\n\r\n$govuk-inverse-button-text-colour: govuk-colour(\"blue\");\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/components/button/index\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was made in [pull request #4043: Add ability to customise inverse button colours](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4043).\r\n\r\n### Remove component initialisation\r\n\r\nRemove `.init()` from individually instantiated components as initialisation now happens automatically:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew Radios($radio).init()\r\n```\r\n\r\n```js\r\nnew Radios($radio)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you initialise the components using `initAll()`, you will not need to make any changes.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #4011: Remove component init() methods and initialise in constructor](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4011).\r\n\r\n### Remove Internet Explorer 8 stylesheets, settings and mixins\r\n\r\nWe no longer support Internet Explorer 8 (IE8) in GOV.UK Frontend or provide dedicated stylesheets for the browser. Remove any references to these stylesheets from your HTML.\r\n\r\nWe've removed the `govuk-if-ie8` and `govuk-not-ie8` mixins, and the `$govuk-is-ie8` and `$govuk-ie8-breakpoint` settings, that were deprecated in [GOV.UK Frontend v4.6.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.6.0).\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3559: Remove IE8-related Sass and CSS build tasks](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3559).\r\n\r\n### Remove the fallback GOV.UK crown logo from your HTML\r\n\r\nThe header component previously included a fallback version of the GOV.UK crown logo for Internet Explorer 8. As Frontend no longer supports IE8, we’ve removed this fallback.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using the Nunjucks macros, you'll need to remove this fallback from your HTML code. In your header component:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the block of HTML containing the `govuk-header__logotype-crown-fallback-image` image, starting with `<!--[if IE 8]>` and ending with `<![endif]-->`.\r\n2. Remove `<!--[if gt IE 8]><!-->` and `<!--<![endif]-->` from around the `govuk-header__logotype-crown` SVG, but don't remove the SVG.\r\n3. Delete the `govuk-logotype-crown.png` file from your assets folder.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to change any HTML if you're using the supplied Nunjucks macros, but you might still need to remove the `govuk-logotype-crown.png` image depending on [how you are serving the font and image assets](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#font-and-image-assets).\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3641: Remove fallback GOV.UK logo for IE8](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3641.\r\n\r\n### Removal of Javascript polyfills for Internet Explorer (IE) 8-11\r\n\r\nWe've removed polyfills for:\r\n\r\n- `DOMTokenList`, `Element.prototype.classList`, `Element.prototype.closest`, `Element.prototype.matches`, and `Event` - required for IE 11 and below\r\n- `Element.prototype.dataset` - required for IE 10 and below\r\n- `Date.now`, `Document`, `Element`, `Element.prototype.nextElementSibling`, `Element.prototype.previousElementSibling`, `Function.prototype.bind`, `Object.defineProperty`, `String.prototype.trim` and `Window` - required for IE 8\r\n\r\nGOV.UK Frontend no longer needs these polyfills because Internet Explorer will no longer try to run our JavaScript if you follow our instructions and include it using `<script type=\"module\">`.\r\n\r\nHowever, because these polyfills create or extend global objects ('polluting the global namespace'), you might have other code in your service unintentionally relying on the inclusion of these polyfills.\r\n\r\nIf your service has JavaScript that you want to run successfully in Internet Explorer (for example JavaScript for analytics), make sure the JavaScript does not rely on the removed polyfills and still executes successfully. You might need to introduce your own polyfills or rewrite your JavaScript to avoid using the polyfilled features.\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in:\r\n\r\n- [pull request #3570: Remove IE8-10 JavaScript polyfills, helpers, config](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3570)\r\n- [pull request #3720: Remove IE11 vendor polyfills](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3720)\r\n\r\n### Removal of font family Sass variables\r\n\r\nWe’ve removed the following Sass variables:\r\n\r\n- `$govuk-font-family-gds-transport`\r\n- `$govuk-font-family-nta`\r\n- `$govuk-font-family-nta-tabular`\r\n\r\nIf you were using `$govuk-font-family-gds-transport` to set the font on an element, we recommend using [the `govuk-font` mixin](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/sass-api-reference/#govuk-font) instead.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3949: Simplify font family settings](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3949).\r\n\r\n### Remove deprecated `.govuk-button--disabled` class\r\n\r\nWe've removed the `.govuk-button--disabled` class that we deprecated in [GOV.UK Frontend v4.6.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.6.0).\r\n\r\nUse the `disabled` attribute to mark `<button>` and `<input>` elements as being disabled instead.\r\n\r\nWe no longer support link buttons being disabled or using disabled styles.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3557: Remove deprecated `.govuk-button--disabled` class](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3557).\r\n\r\n### Remove deprecated `.govuk-!-margin-static` and `.govuk-!-padding-static classes`\r\n\r\nWe've removed the override classes starting with `.govuk-!-margin-static` and `.govuk-!-padding-static`, which were deprecated in [GOV.UK Frontend v4.3.1](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.3.1).\r\n\r\nUse the classes starting with `.govuk-!-static-margin` and `.govuk-!-static-padding` instead.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3593: Remove deprecated static spacing classes](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3593).\r\n\r\n### Remove deprecated `.govuk-header__link--service-name` class\r\n\r\nWe've removed the `.govuk-header__link--service-name` class which we deprecated in [GOV.UK Frontend v4.2.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.2.0).\r\nUse the .govuk-header\\_\\_service-name class instead.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3594: Remove deprecated `.govuk-header__link--service-name` class](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3594).\r\n\r\n### Remove deprecated `.govuk-header__navigation--no-service-name` class\r\n\r\nWe've removed the `.govuk-header__navigation--no-service-name` class which we deprecated in [GOV.UK Frontend v4.3.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.3.0).\r\n\r\nWe no longer supply a dedicated class for headers with navigation but no service name. If you still need this feature, you can reproduce it in your own code using the `govuk-spacing` Sass mixin.\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.govuk-header__navigation {\r\n  padding-top: govuk-spacing(7);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3595: Remove deprecated `.govuk-header__navigation--no-service-name` class](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3595).\r\n\r\n## Suggested changes\r\n\r\n### Update the Pagination component's default `aria-label`\r\n\r\nWe’ve updated the default value of the Pagination component's `aria-label` to be more descriptive of the contents of the region. If you’re using the component's default label, you might wish to update it to the new default of 'Pagination'.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to change anything if you're using the `govukPagination` Nunjucks macro.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3899: Update default `aria-label` in Pagination component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3899).\r\n\r\n### Update the Exit this Page button's default text\r\n\r\nWe’ve updated the default text of the Exit this Page button. It now includes visually-hidden text to clarify that the button is a safety tool and not a generic method of leaving the current page.\r\n\r\nIf you are using the component's default text, you might wish to update it to the new value: `<span class=\"govuk-visually-hidden\">Emergency</span> Exit this page`.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to change anything if you're using the `govukExitThisPage` Nunjucks macro.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #3989: Update default Exit This Page button text](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3989).\r\n\r\n### Add the `rel` attribute to the Exit this Page button and secondary link\r\n\r\nUpdate the Exit this Page button and secondary link to include a new attribute and value: `rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"`.\r\n\r\nAdding this attribute does 2 things:\r\n\r\n1. It instructs search engines that your service does not endorse the external website for the purposes of determining search engine rankings.\r\n2. It instructs web browsers to not send information about your service to the external website.\r\n\r\nThis fixes a potential risk where the external website could detect that a user had visited from a GOV.UK page and play that information back to the user, which could risk a user's personal safety in some contexts.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to change the Exit this Page button if you're using the `govukExitThisPage` Nunjucks macro. You will still have to update the secondary link manually.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #4054: Add `rel` attribute to the Exit this Page button](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/4054).

New features\r\n\r\n### Updated the appearance of disabled form controls\r\n\r\nWe’ve updated the disabled state of Text Input, Textarea, Select and File Upload components so it is consistent across browsers and devices. They’re also now consistent with the existing disabled styles for Buttons, Checkboxes, and Radios.\r\n\r\nDisabled form controls appear at 50% opacity and with an alternative cursor appearance when hovered over.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #3187: Add disabled styles for form controls](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3187).\r\n\r\n### Added a top-level `disabled` parameter to form controls\r\n\r\nWe’ve updated the Nunjucks macros for Text Input, Textarea, Select and File Upload components to include a top-level `disabled` parameter. This will make it easier to enable the disabled state for these controls.\r\n\r\n```nunjucks\r\n{{ govukInput({\r\n  id: \"disabled-input\",\r\n  name: \"disabled-input\",\r\n  value: \"Unchangeable value\",\r\n  disabled: true\r\n}) }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDisabled form controls have poor contrast and can confuse some users, so avoid them if possible.\r\n\r\nOnly use disabled form controls if research shows it makes the user interface easier to understand.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #3187: Add disabled styles for form controls](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3187).\r\n\r\n### Configure whether the Accordion remembers and restores sessions\r\n\r\nBy default, when a user leaves a page, the [Accordion](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/) will remember the layout of expanded and collapsed sections selected by the user. If the user returns to the page, this layout will be restored and override any sections manually set as expanded in code.\r\n\r\nYou can now disable this functionality by using the `rememberExpanded` option in the `govukAccordion` Nunjucks macro.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using the Nunjucks macro, you can disable it using the `data-remember-expanded` HTML attribute.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #3342: Add option to disable sessionState in Accordion](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3342).\r\n\r\n### Added `id` parameter to Buttons\r\n\r\nWe’ve updated the [Button](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/) Nunjucks macro to include an optional `id` parameter.\r\n\r\n```nunjucks\r\n{{ govukButton({\r\n  text: \"Save and continue\",\r\n  id: \"continue-button\"\r\n}) }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #3344: Adding optional ‘id’ attribute to button component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3344).\r\n\r\nThanks to @TomBillingtonUK  for this contribution.\r\n\r\n### Added a modifier for text input styles that accept sequences of digits\r\n\r\nWe've added a new `.govuk-input--extra-letter-spacing` class for [Text Input](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/text-input/). This increases readability of text inputs that receive sequences of digits (like security codes, references or phone numbers).\r\n\r\nYou can add it through the `classes` option when using Nunjucks, or directly in the `class` attribute of the `<input>` when using HTML.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2230: Add extra letter spacing modifier for inputs](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2230)\r\n\r\n## Deprecated features\r\n\r\n### Stop using JavaScript API properties other than the `init` method\r\n\r\nWe have deprecated all of the JavaScript properties in the API, except for the `init` method for each component. We'll make all of the deprecated JavaScript properties private in [our next main release](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/milestone/46).\r\n\r\nPlease [let us know if you're using parts of the API other than the `init` method by filling in this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfmH2AitMeouXqB0FWC5p5e6y1TSiFCjmJ8DrVuwfmpRGCaWw/viewform?usp=sf_link). We'll use this information when prioritising future additions to the public API.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #3499: Deprecate all JavaScript instance properties the except `init` method](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3499).\r\n\r\n### Stop using the `.govuk-button--disabled` class on buttons\r\n\r\nWe have deprecated the `.govuk-button--disabled` class and will remove it in the next major release.\r\n\r\nIf a [Button](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/) uses a `<button>` or `<input>` element, use the disabled HTML attribute instead.\r\n\r\nYou will not need to make any changes if you're using the `govukButton` Nunjucks macro.\r\n\r\nDisabling links that are styled to look like buttons will not be supported by future releases.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #3326: Deprecate `govuk-button--disabled` class](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3326).\r\n\r\n### Stop using the deprecated Internet Explorer 8 mixins and settings\r\n\r\nThe next main release of GOV.UK Frontend will remove support for Internet Explorer 8 (IE8). In preparation for this, we've deprecated the settings and mixins used when [generating IE8 specific stylesheets](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/supporting-ie8/#2-generate-an-ie8-specific-stylesheet).\r\n\r\nYou'll start seeing deprecation warnings if you're:\r\n\r\n- using the [`govuk-if-ie8`](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/sass-api-reference/#govuk-if-ie8) and [`govuk-not-ie8`](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/sass-api-reference/#govuk-not-ie8) mixins in your own Sass code (for example `@include govuk-if-ie8`)\r\n- changing the [`$govuk-is-ie8`](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/sass-api-reference/#govuk-is-ie8) and [`$govuk-ie8-breakpoint`](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/sass-api-reference/#govuk-ie8-breakpoint) settings to anything other than their default values\r\n\r\nIf you no longer need to support IE8, we recommend you stop generating an IE8 specific stylesheet and remove references to the IE8 mixins from your code.\r\n\r\nYou can also silence these deprecation warnings by adding `ie8` to the [`$govuk-suppressed-warnings`](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/sass-api-reference/#govuk-suppressed-warnings) setting, but once we’ve released v5.0 you will need to address them as part of the upgrade process.\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\nWe’ve made fixes to GOV.UK Frontend in the following pull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#3255: Including the JavaScript source map in the prototype kit config](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3255)\r\n- [#3272: Add empty alt attribute to logo IE8 fallback PNG](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3272)\r\n- [#3306: Re-enable complete hover link styles on the footer](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3306)\r\n- [#3312: Add default value for warning text icon fallback attribute](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3312)\r\n- [#3426: Add organisation brand colour for Department for Business & Trade](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/3426) -

New features\r\n\r\n### Change the Button component's background and text colour\r\n\r\nFor non-GOV.UK branded websites, you can now change the Button component background and text colour.\r\n\r\nTo change the Button component background colour, set the `$govuk-button-background-colour` Sass variable.\r\n\r\nTo change the Button component text colour, set the `$govuk-button-text-colour` Sass variable.\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/base\";\r\n\r\n$govuk-button-background-colour: govuk-colour(\"yellow\");\r\n$govuk-button-text-colour:

colour](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2752). Thanks to @NickColley for this contribution.\r\n\r\n### Localise the navigation menu toggle button\r\n\r\nWhen using the [header](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/) Nunjucks macro, you can now translate the text of the mobile navigation menu toggle button by using the `menuButtonText` parameter.\r\n\r\nYou should avoid lengthy values for the `menuButtonText` parameter. If the text is too long it can overflow and cause visual issues.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2720: Add parameter to localise mobile menu toggle button](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2720).\r\n\r\n### Localise the character count's textarea description/fallback text\r\n\r\nWhen using the [character count](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/character-count/) Nunjucks macro, you can now translate the description of textarea by using the `textareaDescriptionText` option.\r\n\r\nThis text is announced by screen readers when the character count input is focused. It's also displayed visually as a fallback if JavaScript is not available.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2742: Add ability to customise character count fallback text](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2742), and the option renamed to `textareaDescriptionText` in [pull request #2915](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2915).\r\n\r\n### Localise the character count's counter message\r\n\r\nYou can now translate the text shown by the [character count](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/character-count/) component to inform users of:\r\n\r\n- when they have reached the maximum number of characters or words\r\n- the number of characters or words over or under the allowed maximum\r\n\r\nThe Nunjucks macro accepts new options so you can customise each message. You can:\r\n\r\n- Use `charactersAtLimitText` or `wordsAtLimitText` to provide the text that shows when users have reached the limit.\r\n- Use `charactersUnderLimitText` or `wordsUnderLimitText` to provide the text that shows when users are under the limit. The component will pluralise the message according to the configured locale and the number of characters or words remaining.\r\n- Use `charactersOverLimitText` or `wordsOverLimitText` to provide the text that shows when users are over the limit. The component will pluralise the message according to the configured locale and the number of characters or words remaining.\r\n\r\nYou'll find guidance about [the plural forms in our documentation about localising GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/localise-govuk-frontend/). The component will replace `%{count}` with the number of characters over or under the limit.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Nunjucks macros, you can use data-* attributes to provide these translations. Within the attribute value, any [quotation marks or other characters reserved by HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity#reserved_characters) needs to be converted into their HTML entity equivalents.\r\n\r\nYou can:\r\n\r\n- use `data-i18n.characters-at-limit` or `data-i18n.words-at-limit` for when users are at the limit\r\n- configure the text that informs the end user they are under the character or word limit, by using `data-i18n.characters-under-limit.{other,many,few,two,one,zero}` or `data-i18n.words-under-limit.{other,many,few,two,one,zero}`, with one suffix for each plural form required by your locale\r\n- configure the text that informs the end user they are over the character or word limit, by using `data-i18n.characters-over-limit.{other,many,few,two,one,zero}` or `data-i18n.words-over-limit.{other,many,few,two,one,zero}`, with one suffix for each plural form required by your locale\r\n\r\nYou can also provide these messages using a JavaScript configuration object when creating an instance of the component or initialising all components. See [our guidance on localising GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/localise-govuk-frontend/) for how to do this.\r\n\r\nThis was added in the following pull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#2895 Add macro options to configure CharacterCount translations](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2895)\r\n- [#2887 Allow CharacterCount component to receive i18n config via JS](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2887)\r\n\r\n### Localise the character count's input description for assistive technologies\r\n\r\nWhen configuring the character count's limit in JavaScript, you can customise the description provided to assistive technologies when users focus the input (so it indicates the overall limit of characters or words).\r\n\r\nDepending on the [plural form required by your locale](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/localise-govuk-frontend/#understanding-pluralisation-rules), you can pass the description in the HTML using the `data-i18n.textarea-description.{other,many,few,two,one,zero}` attribute on the element to provide the text to set as the description.\r\n\r\nYou can also provide these messages using a JavaScript configuration object when creating an instance of the component or initialising all components. See [our guidance on localising GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/localise-govuk-frontend/) for how to do this.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2915](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2915).\r\n\r\n### Localise the accordion's toggle buttons\r\n\r\nYou can now translate the text of the [accordion](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/) component's show and hide toggle buttons.\r\n\r\nWhen using the Nunjucks macro, you can use the new `showSectionText` and `hideSectionText` parameters to customise the text of the 'show' and 'hide' toggles in each section.\r\n\r\nYou can also use `showAllSectionsText` and `hideAllSectionsText` parameters to customise the text of the toggle at the top of the accordion.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using the Nunjucks macro, you can customise these using data-* attributes. Within the attribute value, any [quotation marks or other characters reserved by HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity#reserved_characters) needs to be converted into their HTML entity equivalents.\r\n\r\n- `data-i18n.show-section`\r\n- `data-i18n.show-section-aria-label`\r\n- `data-i18n.hide-section`\r\n- `data-i18n.hide-section-aria-label`\r\n- `data-i18n.show-all-sections`\r\n- `data-i18n.hide-all-sections`\r\n\r\nYou can also change this text for all instances of the Accordion using a JavaScript configuration object. See [our guidance on localising GOV.UK Frontend](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/localise-govuk-frontend/) for how to do this.\r\n\r\nThis was added in pull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#2818: Add support for localisation via data-* attributes to Accordion component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2818)\r\n- [#2826: Add support for localisation via JavaScript configuration to Accordion component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2826)\r\n\r\n### Suppress deprecation warnings\r\n\r\nYou can now suppress warnings from deprecations within GOV.UK Frontend by updating the `$govuk-suppressed-warnings` map in Sass. Every deprecation warning will now include a warning \"key\" which you can use in the following code, placed at the root of your sass project:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n$govuk-suppressed-warnings: (\r\n  deprecated-feature\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was added in [#2911 Add warning suppression functionality](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2911)\r\n\r\n### Configure components in JavaScript\r\n\r\nJavaScript components can get the same configuration options in 2 ways - through data attributes, as before, and now when creating an instance. These components are:\r\n\r\n- the `Button` component, for its `preventDoubleClick` option (matching `data-prevent-double-click`)\r\n- the `CharacterCount` component, for its `maxlength`, `maxwords` and `threshold` options (matching `data-maxlength`, `data-maxwords` and `data-threshold`, respectively)\r\n- the `ErrorSummary` component, for its `disableAutoFocus` option (matching `data-disable-auto-focus`)\r\n- the `NotificationBanner` component, for its `disableAutoFocus` option (matching `data-disable-auto-focus`)\r\n\r\nYou can leave out these configuration options when using the Nunjucks macro and provide configuration when:\r\n\r\n- creating a component, in a configuration object as second argument\r\n- initialising components in bulk using `initAll`\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Creating a single instance\r\nvar button = document.querySelector('[data-module=\"button\"]')\r\nnew GOVUKFrontend.Button(button, {preventDoubleClick: true})\r\n\r\n// Or initialising components in bulk\r\nGOVUKFrontend.initAll({\r\n  button: {\r\n    preventDoubleClick: true\r\n  }\r\n  // Or, for the other components,\r\n  // characterCount: {/* options */},\r\n  // errorSummary: {/* options */},\r\n  // notificationBanner: {/* options */}\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can find more information about component configuration in [GOV.UK Frontend documentation](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/configure-components-with-javascript/).\r\n\r\nThis was added in pull requests specific for each components:\r\n\r\n- [NotificationBanner – #2843](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2843)\r\n- [ErrorSummary – #2854](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2854)\r\n- [Button – #2867](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2867)\r\n- [CharacterCount – #2883](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2883)\r\n\r\n## Recommended changes\r\n\r\n### Update the HTML for the error summary\r\n\r\nIf you're not using the Nunjucks macros, you can improve the experience for screen reader users by making these changes to the error summary markup:\r\n\r\n- Remove `aria-labelledby=\"error-summary-title\"` and `role=\"alert\"` from the parent element (`govuk-error-summary`)\r\n- Add a `div` wrapper around the contents of `govuk-error-summary` with the attribute `role=\"alert\"`\r\n- Remove `id=\"error-summary-title\"` from the error summary `h2` (`govuk-error-summary__title`)\r\n\r\nThis will enable screen reader users to have a better, more coherent experience with the error summary. It will make sure users of JAWS 2022 or later will hear the entire contents of the error summary on page load and therefore have further context on why there is an error on the page they're on.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2677: Amend error summary markup to fix page load focus bug in JAWS 2022](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2677).\r\n\r\n## Deprecated features\r\n\r\n### Stop using the compatibility mode settings\r\n\r\nIn GOV.UK Frontend v5.0 we will stop supporting compatibility with legacy codebases. We are therefore deprecating the compatibility mode variables associated with legacy codebases:\r\n\r\n- `$govuk-compatibility-govukfrontendtoolkit`\r\n- `$govuk-compatibility-govuktemplate`\r\n- `$govuk-compatibility-govukelements`\r\n\r\nThis was introduced in [pull request #2882: Deprecate compatibility mode settings](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2882).\r\n\r\n### Stop using settings associated with legacy codebases\r\n\r\nIn GOV.UK Frontend v5.0 we will stop supporting compatibility with legacy codebases. As part of this, we're deprecating settings controlled by compatibility mode variables. This includes the `govuk-compatibility` mixin and the following settings:\r\n\r\n- `$govuk-use-legacy-palette`\r\n- `$govuk-use-legacy-font`\r\n- `$govuk-typography-use-rem`\r\n- `$govuk-font-family-tabular`\r\n\r\nThis was introduced in [pull request #2844: Remove compatibility mode from govuk-frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2844).\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\nIn [pull request 2851: Support Prototype Kit v13](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2851) we've introduced support for the plugins system included in the upcoming Prototype Kit v13.\r\n\r\nWe've made fixes to GOV.UK Frontend in the following pull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#2807: Tidy up and refactor the Character Count JavaScript](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2807)\r\n- [#2811: Use Element.id to get module id for accordion](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2811)\r\n- [#2821: Avoid duplicated --error class on Character Count](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2821)\r\n- [#2800: Improve Pagination component print styles](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2800)\r\n- [#2909: Fix JavaScript errors when entering text into the Character Count in IE8](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2909)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/82992742/reactions","total_count":12,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":4,"confused":0,"heart":4,"rocket":4,"eyes":0},"mentions_count":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/74738090","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/74738090/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/74738090/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v4.3.1","id":74738090,"author":{"login":"36degrees","id":121939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTkzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees","html_url":"https://github.com/36degrees","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"RE_kwDOBBCSo84EdGmq","tag_name":"v4.3.1","target_commitish":"main","name":"GOV.UK Frontend v4.3.1","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2022-08-18T14:24:00Z","published_at":"2022-08-18T14:25:49Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/assets/75116086","id":75116086,"node_id":"RA_kwDOBBCSo84Eei42","name":"release-v4.3.1.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"36degrees","id":121939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTkzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees","html_url":"https://github.com/36degrees","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":229743,"download_count":258,"created_at":"2022-08-18T14:25:39Z","updated_at":"2022-08-18T14:25:40Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/download/v4.3.1/release-v4.3.1.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/govuk-frontend/tarball/v4.3.1","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/govuk-frontend/zipball/v4.3.1","body":"## Recommended changes\r\n\r\n### Replace deprecated `govuk-!-margin-static` and `govuk-!-padding-static` classes\r\n\r\nWe've fixed an error in the naming convention of the static spacing override classes we'd introduced in v4.3.0. These classes should start with `govuk-!-static`, and we've now deprecated the incorrect classes.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the static spacing margin override classes, replace any classes starting with `govuk-!-margin-static` with `govuk-!-static-margin`.

New features\r\n\r\n#### Customise the Open Graph image URL without duplicate meta tags\r\n\r\nYou can now customise the Open Graph image URL included in the `head` by setting the `opengraphImageUrl` Nunjucks option.\r\n\r\nAlso, the default Open Graph image URL meta tag will now only be included if you set the either `opengraphImageUrl` or `assetUrl`.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2673: Allow Open Graph image URL to be customised](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2673).\r\n\r\n#### Localise the content licence and copyright statements\r\n\r\nWhen using the [footer Nunjucks macro](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/footer/#options-default-1), you can now translate the text of the Open Government Licence (OGL) and Crown copyright statements using the `contentLicence` and `copyright` parameters.\r\n\r\nVisit [The National Archives' documentation on OGL and Crown copyright](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/information-management/re-using-public-sector-information/uk-government-licensing-framework/open-government-licence/copyright-notices-attribution-statements/) for information on what you need to include in these statements.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2702: Allow localisation of content licence and copyright notices in Footer](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2702).\r\n\r\n#### Pass HTML directly into compatible components\r\n\r\nIf using the Nunjucks macros, you can now pass HTML content directly into compatible components using [the Nunjucks call syntax](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#call). If HTML is provided through the call syntax, the nunjucks macro will ignore the HTML and text options.\r\n\r\nComponents updated to support this syntax are:\r\n\r\n- Details\r\n- Error summary (mapped to `descriptionHtml` parameter)\r\n- Inset text\r\n- Notification banner\r\n- Panel\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2734: Update various components to be callable](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2734).\r\n\r\n#### Use new override classes to apply static spacing\r\n\r\nYou can now use static spacing override classes to apply spacing from [the static spacing scale](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/spacing/#static-spacing) to elements of your design.\r\n\r\nThe new classes start with: `govuk-!-static-` followed by either `margin-` or `padding-`, and then a spacing unit number.\r\n\r\nTo apply spacing in a single direction, include `left-`, `right-`, `top-`, or `bottom-` just before the spacing unit.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n-   `govuk-!-static-margin-9` will apply a 60px margin to all sides of the element at all screen sizes\r\n-   `govuk-!-static-padding-right-5` will apply 25px of padding to the right side of the element at all screen sizes    \r\n-   `govuk-!-static-margin-0` will remove all margins at all screen sizes\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2672: Add static spacing override classes](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2672). Thanks to @patrickpatrickpatrick for this contribution.\r\n\r\n### Deprecated features\r\n\r\n#### Remove deprecated `govuk-header__navigation--no-service-name` class in the header\r\n\r\nWe've deprecated the `govuk-header__navigation--no-service-name` class, and will remove it in a future major release.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2694: Deprecate .govuk-header__navigation--no-service-name](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2694).\r\n\r\n### Recommended changes\r\n\r\nWe've recently made some non-breaking changes to GOV.UK Frontend. Implementing these changes will make your service work better.\r\n\r\n#### Add `hidden` to the mobile menu button in the header component\r\n\r\nIf you're not using the Nunjucks macros, add the `hidden` attribute to the mobile menu button in the header component. The mobile menu button is `govuk-header__menu-button`.\r\n\r\nWe've changed the header's mobile menu functionality to use the `hidden` attribute instead of using CSS to show/hide the mobile menu. Adding `hidden` to the mobile menu button by default will make sure that it does not display for users when javascript does not load.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request 2727: Make use of hidden in header navigation functionality](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2727). Thanks to @NickColley and @kr8n3r for their contributions.\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\nIn [pull request 2678: Replace ex units with ems for input lengths](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2678), we changed how we define input lengths in our CSS.

For example, in search results or guidance that's divided into multiple website pages.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2610: Add pagination component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2610).\r\n\r\n#### Check checkboxes by using the `values` Nunjucks option\r\n\r\nWhen using the `govukCheckboxes` Nunjucks macro, you can now use the `values` option to determine which checkboxes should already be checked when the page loads.\r\n\r\nFor example, `values: ['red', 'blue']` would check any checkboxes that have a `value` of 'red' or 'blue'.\r\n\r\nYou can use this option instead of setting the boolean `checked` option on each individual checkbox.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2616: Allow selecting options by passing current values](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2616).\r\n\r\n#### Check a radio button by using the `value` Nunjucks option\r\n\r\nWhen using the `govukRadios` Nunjucks macro, you can now use the `value` option to determine which radio should already be checked when the page loads.\r\n\r\nFor example, `value: 'red'` would check the radio that has a `value` of 'red'.\r\n\r\nYou can use this option instead of setting the boolean `checked` option on each individual radio.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2616: Allow selecting options by passing current values](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2616).\r\n\r\n#### Select an option in a select by using the `value` Nunjucks option\r\n\r\nWhen using the `govukSelect` Nunjucks macro, you can now use the `value` option to determine which option should already be selected when the page loads.\r\n\r\nFor example, `value: 'red'` would select the option that has a `value` of 'red'.\r\n\r\nYou can use this option instead of setting the boolean `selected` option on each individual option.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2616: Allow selecting options by passing current values](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2616).\r\n\r\n### Recommended changes\r\n\r\n#### Replace deprecated `govuk-header__link--service-name` class in the header\r\n\r\nIf you're not using the Nunjucks macros in the header, replace any instances of the class `govuk-header__link--service-name` with `govuk-header__service-name`.\r\n\r\nWe've deprecated the `govuk-header__link--service-name` class, and will remove it in a future major release.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2617: Do not make the service name in the header a link if no `serviceUrl` is provided](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2617).\r\n\r\n#### File extensions added for JavaScript ES Module imports\r\n\r\nWe have updated our component ES module JavaScript to include [missing file extensions](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#mandatory-file-extensions) not provided in release 4.1.0. If you have received an error similar to the following, for example when running or building your application, this fix should resolve the issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCannot find module '../node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk-esm/common' imported from ../node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk-esm/all.mjs\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should not need to make any changes if you are successfully importing our JavaScript as ES modules with version 4.1.0, but there still might be config you can remove. For example, removing `fullySpecified: false` from your Webpack config file.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2658: Add missing mandatory file extensions for ESM JavaScript](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2658).

You will not be required to make any changes unless you want to.\r\n\r\nIf you want to import using ES modules, we recommend you only use `import` to import the JavaScript for components you're using in your service. For example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { SkipLink, Radios } from 'govuk-frontend'\r\n\r\nvar $skipLink = document.querySelector('[data-module=\"govuk-skip-link\"]')\r\nif ($skipLink) {\r\n  new SkipLink($skipLink).init()\r\n}\r\n\r\nvar $radios = document.querySelectorAll('[data-module=\"govuk-radios]')\r\nif ($radios) {\r\n  for (var i = 0; i < $radios.length; i++) {\r\n    new Radios($radios[i]).init()\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you need to import all of GOV.UK Frontend's components, then use the `initAll` function to initialise them:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { initAll } from 'govuk-frontend'\r\ninitAll()\r\n```\r\n\r\nDepending on the bundler you use, you may also need to make changes to your JavaScript bundler configuration file. You can [read more in our installation instructions about importing JavaScript using a bundler](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#import-javascript-using-a-bundler).\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2586: Publish our JavaScript as ES modules alongside Universal Module Definition (UMD)](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2586).\r\n\r\n### Recommended changes\r\n\r\nWe've recently made some non-breaking changes to GOV.UK Frontend.

However, to make sure your service still works after you upgrade, you should read the release notes and make any required changes.\r\n\r\n### Check your accordions still display as expected\r\n\r\nWe've changed the design of the accordion. You can [see its new look and read the revised guidance, particularly about when and when not to use accordions](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/).\r\n\r\nYou should check your accordions still display as expected if you have any:\r\n\r\n- accordions with custom styles\r\n- section headings that contain unusual formatting (for example, wrappers)\r\n\r\nYou do not need to make changes to the content that accordions hide or show, as this release's changes do not affect it.\r\n\r\nThese changes were introduced in [pull request #2257: Update accordion design](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2257). Thanks to @mia-allers-gds, @owenatgov, @nnagewad and @chris-gds for their contributions.\r\n\r\n### Only use the accordion’s summary line for ‘phrasing content’\r\n\r\nThe summary line is now inside the HTML `button` element, so you can only add ['phrasing content'](https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/content-models.html#phrasing-content-0) to it. Do not use any non-phrasing content, as the resulting HTML will not be valid.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2257: Update accordion design](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2257).\r\n\r\n### Review and revise the accordion's summary line content\r\n\r\nOnly add a summary line if you need to, as it's likely to make the button text too long.\r\n\r\nIf you're already using the summary line, review your use of the summary line to make sure you actually need it.\r\n\r\nIf you need to keep the summary line, [review the accordion guidance](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/accordion/) and make the summary line as short as possible.\r\n\r\n### Update the HTML for summary lists\r\n\r\nWe've updated the HTML for the summary list component to avoid nesting `<span>` elements within `<dd>` elements, which is invalid HTML. This update only affects you if you have summary lists that include a mix of rows with and without actions. You can [read more about adding actions to rows](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/summary-list/#adding-actions-to-each-row).\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Nunjucks macros, do not include an empty `<span class=\"govuk-summary-list__actions\"></span>` in rows without actions. Instead, add the `govuk-summary-list__row--no-actions` modifier class to the row.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2323: Avoid invalid nesting of `<span>` within a `<dd>` in summary list](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2323). Thanks to @malcolmhire for reporting this issue.\r\n\r\n### Update the HTML for navigation in the header\r\n\r\nWe've updated the HTML for the header. This update only affects you if your header includes navigation.\r\n\r\nAny additional classes passed using the `navigationClasses` Nunjucks option are now applied to the `<nav>` rather than the `<ul>`. Check the additional classes are still doing what you expect.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Nunjucks macros, then you should:\r\n\r\n- move the `<button>` inside the `<nav>`, immediately before the `<ul>`\r\n- move the `aria-label` attribute from the `<ul>` to the `<nav>`\r\n- move the `govuk-header__navigation` class from the `<ul>` to the `<nav>`\r\n- add the `govuk-header__navigation-list` class to the `<ul>`\r\n\r\n[Check your changes against the header example in the Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/#header-with-service-name-and-navigation) to make sure you have correctly implemented them.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2427: Improve the screen reader experience for the header menu](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2427).\r\n\r\n### Style any custom HTML in your cookie banner\r\n\r\nWe've removed the default font styles from the cookie banner Sass. This change makes it more obvious when you have not added classes and styles to any custom HTML.\r\n\r\nIf you're passing custom HTML into the cookie banner component (for example, using the `html` Nunjucks parameter), you must make sure you're applying the appropriate classes and styles to that HTML. This could look like, for example, adding the `govuk-body` class to any paragraph tags. You must do this to prevent your cookie banner displaying with unstyled text.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2432: Remove default font styles from cookie banner Sass](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2432).\r\n\r\n### Update the HTML for hints\r\n\r\nIn GOV.UK Frontend v3.8.0, we [updated the HTML for hints to use a `<div>` rather than a `<span>` element, to allow the use of block elements](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1835). We've now removed the styles which made the hint `<span>` display as block.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not using Nunjucks macros, update your hint HTML to use a `<div>` rather than a `<span>`. For example: `<div id=\"input-hint\" class=\"govuk-hint\"></div>` instead of `<span id=\"input-hint\" class=\"govuk-hint\"></span>`.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2437: Remove `display:block` on hint component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2437).\r\n\r\n### Include JavaScript for skip link to improve screen reader announcements\r\n\r\nWe've added JavaScript for the skip link component to set focus to the linked element, for example, the main content on the page. This helps screen readers read the linked content when users use the skip link component.\r\n\r\nIf you're [importing JavaScript for individual components](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#select-and-initialise-an-individual-component), import the skip link JavaScript.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Nunjucks macros, add a `data-module=\"govuk-skip-link\"` attribute to the component HTML. For example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"govuk-skip-link\" data-module=\"govuk-skip-link\">\r\n...\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you've made the changes, check the skip link JavaScript works. To do this, select the skip link and check the linked element (usually the `<main>` element) in the browser has a `tabindex` attribute.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2450: Set focus to skip link target to improve screen reader announcements](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2450).\r\n\r\n### Update the HTML for error messages\r\n\r\nWe’ve updated the HTML for the error message component to use a paragraph (`<p>`) element instead of a `<span>` element, as this is more semantically correct.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not using Nunjucks macros, swap the `<span class=\"govuk-error-message\">` for a `<p class=\"govuk-error-message\">`.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2452: Update error messages to use paragraph tags instead of spans](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2452).\r\n\r\n### Check components that conditionally reveal content still work\r\n\r\nOn radios and checkboxes, the JavaScript now looks within the whole page for conditionally-revealed content. Before, it only looked within the same set of radios or checkboxes.\r\n\r\nIf you see unexpected behaviour, [make sure the revealed content's `id` is unique within the page the content is on](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/html/H93). Reusing the same `id` within a page could cause a radio or checkbox to reveal or hide the wrong element, and also means your HTML is invalid.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2370: Prevent issues with conditionally revealed content when content `id` includes CSS syntax characters](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2370).\r\n\r\n### Check the character count component still works as expected\r\n\r\nOn character counts, the JavaScript now looks within the whole page for the count message, which will be something similar to “You have 200 characters remaining”. Before, it only looked within the character count component.\r\n\r\nIf you see unexpected behaviour, make sure the `id` for the textarea component is unique within the page the content is on. Reusing the same `id` within a page could cause the wrong count message to update, and also means your HTML is invalid.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2408: Prevent issues with character count when textarea `id` includes CSS syntax characters](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2408).\r\n\r\n### Check individually-imported JavaScript modules work as expected\r\n\r\nYou do not need to do anything if you have done at least one of the following:\r\n\r\n- followed our [Getting Started guide](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/#5-get-the-javascript-working) and are importing all of the GOV.UK Frontend JavaScript in one go via `all.js`\r\n- installed GOV.UK Frontend using precompiled files\r\n\r\nWe've changed the naming of our components' JavaScript modules so individual imports are now attached to\r\n`window.GOVUKFrontend.[ComponentName]` instead of `window.GOVUKFrontend`.\r\n\r\nYou can now import multiple modules without overwriting the previous one, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n//= require govuk/components/accordion/accordion.js\r\n//= require govuk/components/button/button.js\r\n\r\n# These modules are available under window.GOVUKFrontend.Accordion and window.GOVUKFrontend.Button respectively\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're importing JavaScript modules individually, you should check any references to `window.GOVUKFrontend` in your code and update them to point to the correct component, `window.GOVUKFrontend.[ComponentName]`. You can now remove any workarounds you may have implemented.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2426: Rename exported JavaScript modules to include component name](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2426). Thanks to @alex-ju for reporting this issue.\r\n\r\n### Import 'base' before importing Sass files from `core` or `overrides` layers\r\n\r\nIf you import individual files from the `core` or `overrides` layers, you might see the error `Undefined mixin 'govuk-exports'` or `no mixin named govuk-exports` when compiling your Sass.\r\n\r\nTo fix the error, import `node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/base` first. For example:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/base\";\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/core/typography\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2455: Remove 'base' import from files in `core` and `overrides` layers](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2455).\r\n\r\n### Import 'template' Sass file from the `objects` layer instead of the `core` layer\r\n\r\nIf you import the 'template' Sass file from the `core` layer, you might see the error `File to import not found or unreadable: template` when compiling your Sass.\r\n\r\nTo fix this error, replace any imports of `node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/core/template` with `node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/objects/template`.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2463: Move template styles from `core` to `objects` layer](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2463).\r\n\r\n### Check your footer displays as expected\r\n\r\nWe’ve made some fixes to the alignment of columns within the footer component, so they now align with our grid. We've also removed the logic that assumes a 2-section layout displays as a 'two-thirds and one-third' layout. Footer sections now display as full-width by default.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the Nunjucks macros, check your footer displays as expected and use the `width` macro option to set the width you want for each section.\r\n\r\nIf you're not using the Nunjucks macros, check your footer displays as expected and use the standard Design System grid classes on the `govuk-footer__section` element to set the width. For example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"govuk-footer__section govuk-grid-column-two-thirds\">...</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2462: Fix footer alignment with grid classes and add `width` macro option](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2462).\r\n\r\n### Remove deprecated `$govuk-border-width-form-element-error` variable\r\n\r\nIn [GOV.UK Frontend v3.8.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v3.8.0), we made the border width of form elements in their error state the same as for form elements in their normal state and deprecated the `$govuk-border-width-form-element-error` variable.\r\n\r\nBefore, an element's border got thicker to show the element was in an error state. However, elements in their focused state also have a thicker border. As a result, when users focused an element in an error state, the only visible border-change was from red to black. Not all users could perceive this change. So, we reduced the element border's width, to make sure its thickness changes when users focus.\r\n\r\nWe've now removed `$govuk-border-width-form-element-error` completely.\r\n\r\nIf you’re referencing `$govuk-border-width-form-element-error` in your own Sass, you must remove it. If you're also defining your own error state, you only need to change the border colour.\r\n\r\nYou should avoid overriding the border width. For example, replace `border: $govuk-border-width-form-element-error solid $govuk-error-colour;` with `border-color: $govuk-error-colour;`.\r\n\r\nYou should also remove any override of `$govuk-border-width-form-element-error` from your Sass. This override no longer does anything.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #1963: Remove deprecated `$govuk-border-width-form-element-error` variable](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1963).\r\n\r\n### Remove deprecated `govuk-main-wrapper` and `govuk-main-wrapper--l` mixins\r\n\r\nWe've removed the `govuk-main-wrapper` and `govuk-main-wrapper--l` mixins we deprecated in [GOV.UK Frontend v3.0.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v3.0.0).\r\n\r\nRemove any use of these mixins in your own Sass. You can replace these mixins with direct references to the [spacing mixins](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/spacing/#spacing-on-custom-components).\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2385: Remove deprecated `govuk-main-wrapper` and `govuk-main-wrapper--l` mixins](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2385).\r\n\r\n### Remove calls to deprecated `iff` Sass function\r\n\r\nWe've removed the `iff` function we deprecated in [GOV.UK Frontend version 3.6.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v3.6.0).\r\n\r\nIf you’re calling `iff` from your own Sass, you should use [Sass's native `if` function](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/modules#if) instead.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2409: Remove deprecated `iff` Sass function](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2409).\r\n\r\n### Remove deprecated `govuk-tag--inactive` class\r\n\r\nWe've removed the `govuk-tag--inactive` class we deprecated in [GOV.UK Frontend v3.6.0](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v3.6.0).\r\n\r\nReplace any use of this class with the `govuk-tag--grey` class.\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2417: Remove deprecated `govuk-tag--inactive class`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2417).\r\n\r\n## Recommended changes\r\n\r\nWe've recently made some other changes to GOV.UK Frontend. While these are not breaking changes, implementing them will make your service work better.\r\n\r\nYou do not need to do anything if you're using Nunjucks macros.\r\n\r\n### Change date input from `type=\"number\"` to `inputmode=\"numeric\"`\r\n\r\nThere are some known issues with inputs of `type=\"number\"`. [Read our research into the issues with `type=\"number\"`.](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1449#issuecomment-503186819)\r\n\r\nIf you’re not using Nunjucks macros, remove the `type=\"number\"` attribute from the date input component.\r\n\r\nReplace it with `type=\"text\"` and `inputmode=\"numeric\"`. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<input class=\"govuk-input govuk-date-input__input\" id=\"passport-issued-month\" name=\"passport-issued-month\" type=\"text\" pattern=\"[0-9]*\" inputmode=\"numeric\">\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #1704: Update date input to use `type=text` and  `inputmode=numeric`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1704).\r\n\r\n### Fix fallback logo so Chrome will not flag it to screen readers\r\n\r\nIf you’re not using Nunjucks macros, change the SVG markup within the header, footer and button components. We’ve added this fix so screen readers will not announce the fallback image to users.\r\n\r\nFor the header, footer and button, replace `role=\"presentation\"` with `aria-hidden=\"true\"`. For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<svg class=\"govuk-button__start-icon\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"17.5\" height=\"19\" viewBox=\"0 0 33 40\" aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #1724: Fix fallback logo so Chrome will not flag it to screen readers](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1724).\r\n\r\n### Add `data-nosnippet` attribute to cookie banner\r\n\r\nApply a `data-nosnippet` attribute to the cookie banner component to stop it appearing in Google Search snippets.\r\n\r\nIf you’re not using Nunjucks macros, add a new `data-nosnippet` attribute to the cookie banner.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div class=\"govuk-cookie-banner \" data-nosnippet role=\"region\" aria-label=\"Cookies on your service\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change was introduced in [pull request #2192: Add `data-nosnippet` to prevent cookie banner text appearing in Google Search snippets](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2192).\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\nWe’ve made fixes to GOV.UK Frontend in the following pull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#2255: Prevent conditionally revealed questions getting out of sync when multiple sets of radios and checkboxes contain inputs with the same name](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2255)\r\n- [#2323: Avoid invalid nesting of `<span>` within a `<dd>` in summary list](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2323)\r\n- [#2370: Prevent issues with conditionally revealed content when content `id` includes CSS syntax characters](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2370)\r\n- [#2408: Prevent issues with character count when textarea `id` includes CSS syntax characters](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2408)\r\n- [#2426: Rename exported JavaScript modules to include component name](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2426)\r\n- [#2434: Add brand colour for Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC)](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2434) -

there is [a Chromium bug that affects such links](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/2204)\r\n\r\nTo enable this feature, set `$govuk-new-link-styles` to `true` before you import GOV.UK Frontend in your Sass:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n// application.scss\r\n$govuk-new-link-styles: true;\r\n@import \"govuk-frontend/all\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have created your own link styles, you should review them to ensure their use is consistent across your service.\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to be consistent in your use of link styles, we’ve also introduced new mixins and modifier classes for:\r\n\r\n- removing underlines\r\n- displaying white text on dark backgrounds\r\n\r\nThese new link styles will be enabled by default in a future major version of GOV.UK Frontend.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2183: Updates to link styles and link hover states](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2183).\r\n\r\n### Style links to remove underlines\r\n\r\nYou can now remove underlines from links by using either the:\r\n- [`govuk-link-style-no-underline` mixin](http://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/sass-api-reference/#govuk-link-style-no-underline) in your Sass, or\r\n- [`govuk-link--no-underline` class](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/#links-without-underlines) in your HTML\r\n\r\nAn underline still appears when the user hovers their cursor over the link.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2214: Add no-underline mixin and modifier class](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2214).\r\n\r\n### Style links on dark backgrounds\r\n\r\nYou can now style links on dark backgrounds to use white text colour by using either the:\r\n- [`govuk-link-style-inverse` mixin](http://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/sass-api-reference/#govuk-link-style-inverse) in your Sass, or\r\n- [`govuk-link--inverse` class](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/#links-on-dark-backgrounds) in your HTML\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #2213: Add inverse link mixin and modifier class](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/2213).\r\n\r\n### Add links styled as buttons to cookie banners\r\n\r\nYou can now add links styled as buttons to cookie banners.

state](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1870).\r\n\r\n### Set spellcheck with a new option\r\n\r\nYou can now turn spellcheck on or off in the input, textarea and character count components using the new `spellcheck` option instead of the `attributes` option.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{{ govukInput({\r\n    spellcheck: true\r\n}) }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was added in pull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#1859: Add spellcheck option](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1859)\r\n- [#1869: Add missing spellcheck param to character count](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1869)\r\n\r\n## Deprecated features\r\n\r\n### $govuk-border-width-form-element-error\r\n\r\nFrom GOV.UK Frontend v4.0.0, you'll no longer be able to reference the [`$govuk-border-width-form-element-error`](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/sass-api-reference/#govuk-border-width-form-element-error) Sass setting.\r\n\r\nChange any references to `$govuk-border-width-form-element-error` in your Sass code so they reference `$govuk-border-width-form-element` instead.\r\n\r\nThis was changed in [pull request #1870: Reduce border width of form inputs in the error state](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1870).\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\nWe’ve made fixes to GOV.UK Frontend in the following pull requests:\r\n\r\n-

New features\r\n\r\n### Add extra spacing between list items\r\n\r\nIf a [list](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/#lists) is hard to read because the items run across multiple lines, you can now [add extra spacing between list items](http://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/typography/#adding-extra-spacing-between-list-items) using the new `govuk-list--spaced` class.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #1775: Add list--spaced modifier](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1775). Thanks to @frankieroberto for raising this issue.\r\n\r\n### Use HTML for navigation items in the header\r\n\r\nYou can now use HTML for a navigation item in the [header](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/) component, using the new `html` option.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #1819: Add the ability to specify HTML for a navigation item](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1819). Thanks to @adamsilver.\r\n\r\n### Import settings, tools and helpers CSS in one line\r\n\r\nYou can now import `node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/base`, instead of importing `settings`, `helpers` and `tools` separately.\r\n\r\n### Sass now compiles faster\r\n\r\nGOV.UK Frontend's Sass files now compile to CSS faster, because we've changed the way dependencies work when you import them.\r\n\r\nIf you already import `node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/all` in your Sass file, you do not need to do anything. Sass will automatically compile faster.\r\n\r\nIf you import specific parts of GOV.UK Frontend in your Sass file instead, you can now make Sass compile faster by importing `base` then a component's `index` file. This will avoid GOV.UK Frontend importing dependencies multiple times.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/base\";\r\n\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/core/all\";\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/objects/all\";\r\n\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/components/button/index\";\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/components/footer/index\";\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/components/header/index\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nFind out more about [importing CSS](https://frontend.design-system.service.gov.uk/importing-css-assets-and-javascript/#css).\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #1804: Allow components to be imported without dependencies](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1804). Thanks to @kevindew for raising this issue.\r\n\r\n### Collapse breadcrumb component on mobile\r\n\r\nYou can now [collapse the breadcrumb component on mobile](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/breadcrumbs/#collapsing-breadcrumbs-on-mobile-devices) using the new `collapseOnMobile` option, so it:\r\n\r\n- shows only the first and last items\r\n- does not wrap\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #1754: Add collapseOnMobile breadcrumbs flag](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1754). Thanks to @vanitabarrett and @miaallers.\r\n\r\n### Back links are easier to select\r\n\r\nThe [back link](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/back-link/) component is now:\r\n\r\n- bigger, so it's easier to select if you're using a touch screen\r\n- more consistent with the design of the breadcrumb component \r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #1753: Make back link arrow consistent with breadcrumb component](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1753). Thanks to @vanitabarrett and @miaallers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Deprecated features\r\n\r\n### Importing from the `core` and `overrides` layers without `base`\r\n\r\nIf you import specific files from the `core` or `overrides` layers, you’ll now see a deprecation warning when compiling Sass if you do not import `node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/base` first.\r\n\r\nTo fix the warning, import `node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/base` first. For example:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/base\";\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/core/typography\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you do not import `node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/base` first, your service will no longer work from GOV.UK Frontend v4.0.0.\r\n\r\nThis was added in [pull request #1807: Warn if importing core, overrides without dependencies](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1807).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Fixes\r\n\r\nWe’ve made fixes to GOV.UK Frontend in the following pull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#1778: Fix accordion underline hover state being removed when hovering plus/minus symbol](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1778)\r\n- [#1765: Import textarea from character count](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1765)\r\n- [#1796: Standardise accordion section headings font size (reduce height of section headings on mobile)](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1796)"},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/24291141","assets_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/24291141/assets","upload_url":"https://uploads.github.com/repos/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/24291141/assets{?name,label}","html_url":"https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v3.6.0","id":24291141,"author":{"login":"36degrees","id":121939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTkzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees","html_url":"https://github.com/36degrees","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"node_id":"MDc6UmVsZWFzZTI0MjkxMTQx","tag_name":"v3.6.0","target_commitish":"master","name":"GOV.UK Frontend v3.6.0","draft":false,"prerelease":false,"created_at":"2020-03-06T14:23:08Z","published_at":"2020-03-06T14:24:01Z","assets":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/assets/18523073","id":18523073,"node_id":"MDEyOlJlbGVhc2VBc3NldDE4NTIzMDcz","name":"release-v3.6.0.zip","label":null,"uploader":{"login":"36degrees","id":121939,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyMTkzOQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/121939?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees","html_url":"https://github.com/36degrees","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/36degrees/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"content_type":"application/zip","state":"uploaded","size":223836,"download_count":54,"created_at":"2020-03-06T14:23:56Z","updated_at":"2020-03-06T14:23:57Z","browser_download_url":"https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/download/v3.6.0/release-v3.6.0.zip"}],"tarball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/govuk-frontend/tarball/v3.6.0","zipball_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/alphagov/govuk-frontend/zipball/v3.6.0","body":"## New features\r\n\r\n### Use colours with the tag component\r\n\r\nYou can now [use colour with tags](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/tag/#using-colour-with-tags) to help distinguish between different tags -

template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1626).\r\n\r\n### Set a custom width for wrappers\r\n\r\nIf you're using Sass, you can now use the `govuk-width-container` mixin to create a custom wrapper class with a specific width. You can then add that class to the following wrappers to override the width of the `govuk-width-container` class:\r\n\r\n- [page wrapper](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/layout/#page-wrappers)\r\n- [header container](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/)\r\n- [footer container](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/footer/)\r\n\r\nTo create your custom wrapper class, include the `govuk-width-container` mixin. Pass in the width in pixels.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.app-width-container--wide {\r\n  @include govuk-width-container(1200px);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you’re using Nunjucks, you should then add your class using either the:\r\n\r\n- `containerClasses` variable in the [page template](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/page-template/#variables)\r\n- `containerClasses` option in the [header](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/header/) or [footer](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/footer/)\r\n\r\nUse the `$govuk-page-width` Sass variable instead if all your pages are the same width.\r\n\r\n- [Pull request #1626: Allow creating custom width containers and using them with template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1626).\r\n\r\n### Add attributes to the `<body>` element of a page\r\n\r\nYou can now add attributes to the `<body>` element of a page, by

This includes making sure that the styles, components and patterns in GOV.UK Frontend meet level AA of WCAG 2.1.\r\n\r\nWe recommend you [update GOV.UK Frontend with npm](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/updating-with-npm.md).\r\n\r\nIf you’re updating [compiled files](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-from-dist.md), you only need to:\r\n\r\n- update and add data-module attributes\r\n- update CSS class names\r\n\r\n[Contact the GOV.UK Design System team](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-in-touch/) if you need help updating or installing GOV.UK Frontend.\r\n\r\nThanks to [@colinrotherham](https://github.com/colinrotherham), [edwardhorsford](https://github.com/edwardhorsford), [@frankieroberto](https://github.com/frankieroberto) and [@Nooshu](https://github.com/Nooshu) for their help with this release.\r\n\r\n## Breaking changes\r\nYou must make the following changes when you migrate to this release, or your service may break.\r\n\r\n### Update file paths, attributes and class names\r\nTo make sure GOV.UK Frontend's files do not conflict with your code, we've moved our package files into a directory called `govuk`.\r\n\r\n#### If you’re using Sass\r\n\r\nAdd `govuk/` after `govuk-frontend/` to `@import` paths in your [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) file.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/all\";\r\n```\r\nIf you’ve [added `node_modules/govuk-frontend` as a Sass include path](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md#optional-resolving-scss-import-paths), add `govuk/` to your `@import` paths:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n@import \"govuk/all\";\r\n```\r\n\r\n####  If you’re using Javascript\r\n\r\nYou must do the following.\r\n\r\n1. Update file paths.\r\n2. Update and add `data-module` attributes.\r\n3. Update CSS class names.\r\n\r\n##### Update file paths\r\n\r\nYou must add `govuk/` to your import paths.\r\n\r\nIf you're importing `node_modules/govuk-frontend/all.js`, change this import path to `node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/all.js`.\r\n\r\nIf you’re importing a specific path, add `govuk/` after `govuk-frontend/`. For example, if you're importing the button component:\r\n\r\n```nunjucks\r\nimport Button from 'govuk-frontend/govuk/components/button/button'\r\n```\r\n\r\n##### Update and add data-module attributes\r\n\r\nYou do not need to do anything if you're using Nunjucks macros and the [`initAll`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md#option-1-include-javascript) function.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Nunjucks macros, add a `govuk-` prefix to `data-module` attribute values. For example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"govuk-accordion\" data-module=\"govuk-accordion\">\r\n...\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe [button](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/) and [details](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/details/) components now also use the `data-module` attribute for initialisation. If you are not using Nunjucks macros, add:\r\n\r\n- `data-module=\"govuk-button\"` to each `<button>` HTML tag\r\n- `data-module=\"govuk-details\"` to each `<details>` HTML tag\r\n\r\nIf you're using your own JavaScript code to initialise components, add a `govuk-` prefix to any selectors that find components using the `data-module` attribute.\r\n\r\n[Pull request #1443: Ensure GOV.UK Frontend component selectors cannot conflict when initialised](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1443)\r\n\r\n##### Update CSS class names\r\n\r\nYou do not need to do anything if you're using Nunjucks.\r\n\r\nIf you're using HTML or custom JavaScript, change:\r\n\r\n- `js-character-count` to `govuk-js-character-count`\r\n- `js-header-toggle` in the GOV.UK Frontend header component to `govuk-js-header-toggle`\r\n\r\n[Pull request #1444: Renames `js-` css prefix to `govuk-js-`](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1444)\r\n\r\n#### If you’re using Nunjucks\r\n\r\n1. Change the list of paths in `nunjucks.configure` so that the only GOV.UK Frontend path is `node_modules/govuk-frontend/`:\r\n\r\n```nunjucks\r\nnunjucks.configure([\r\n  \"node_modules/govuk-frontend/\"\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. If you've extended the [page template](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/page-template/), add `govuk/` to the template path:\r\n\r\n```nunjucks\r\n{% extends \"govuk/template.njk\" %}\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Change the import paths in your components so they include `govuk/components/`. For example:\r\n\r\n```nunjucks\r\n{% from \"govuk/components/breadcrumbs/macro.njk\" import govukBreadcrumbs %}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Update asset paths\r\n\r\nIn the assets path, add `govuk/` after `govuk-frontend/`:\r\n\r\n`/node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/assets`\r\n\r\nIf your code uses Express.js, you must also use the following code in your configuration file:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\napp.use('/assets', express.static(path.join(__dirname, '/node_modules/govuk-frontend/govuk/assets')))\r\n```\r\nPull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#1458: Namespace nunjucks and components](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1458)\r\n- [#1467: Update the main entry point in package.json](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1467)\r\n\r\n### Migrate to the new accessible focus states\r\n\r\nThe focus state of components now meets the new WCAG 2.1 level AA requirements.\r\n\r\nYou must [update your component’s focus state](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/focus-states/) to make your design consistent with our new focus styles.\r\n\r\nIf you've extended or created components, you can no longer use the `govuk-focusable` or `govuk-focusable-fill` Sass mixins.\r\n\r\nIf you're using `govuk-focusable`, you must remove it. There’s no direct replacement, so you must [use our Sass variables to make your components consistent](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-started/focus-states/#make-other-focusable-elements-accessible) with GOV.UK Frontend.\r\n\r\nIf you're using `govuk-focusable-fill`, include the `govuk-focused-text` mixin inside your component's `:focus` selector. For example:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.app-component:focus {\r\n  @include govuk-focused-text;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#1309: Update links (and things that look like links) to use the new focus style](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1309)\r\n- [#1312: Update form inputs focus to comply with WCAG 2.1](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1312)\r\n- [#1313: Add new focus style to buttons](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1315)\r\n- [#1321: Update footer links to use new focus style](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1321)\r\n- [#1324: Update accordion to use new WCAG 2.1 compliant focus style](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1324)\r\n- [#1326: Update tabs component to WCAG 2.1 compliant focus style](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1326)\r\n- [#1361: Remove `govuk-focusable`, `govuk-focusable-fill` mixins, introduce `govuk-focus-text` mixin](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1361)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Update colours\r\n\r\nYou can now use the following new colour variables that we've added to the [colour palette](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/colour#main-colours):\r\n\r\n- dark-blue\r\n- dark-grey\r\n- mid-grey\r\n- light-grey\r\n\r\n5 Sass colour variables no longer exist. Replace the following colour variables if you're using Sass:\r\n\r\nColour variable removed|Suggested replacement\r\n| --- | --- |\r\nbright-red|red\r\ngrey-1|dark-grey\r\ngrey-2|mid-grey\r\ngrey-3|light-grey\r\ngrey-4|light-grey\r\n\r\nYou should check the [contrast ratio of your colours](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/colour#colour-contrast).\r\n\r\nIf you're not using Sass, change the values of the following colours:\r\n\r\nColour name|Old value|Replace with\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\npurple|#2e358b|#4c2c92\r\nred|#b10e1e|#d4351c\r\nyellow|#ffbf47|#ffdd00\r\ngreen|#006435|#00703c\r\ngrey-2|#bfc1c3|#b1b4b6\r\ngrey-3|#dee0e2|#f3f2f1\r\ngrey-4|#f8f8f8|#f3f2f1\r\nlight-blue|#2b8cc4|#5694ca\r\nblue|#005ea5|#1d70b8\r\nbright-red|#df3034|#d4351c\r\n\r\nWe've also changed the background of the following components:\r\n\r\n- buttons - `green` instead of a custom green\r\n- confirmation panels - `green` instead of `turquoise`\r\n- links in their hover state - `dark-blue` instead of `light-blue`\r\n\r\nIf you're using legacy projects like GOV.UK Elements, you can keep your current colours by [turning on compatibility mode](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/compatibility.md).\r\n\r\nRead our [blog post about why we changed the colour palette](https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2019/07/29/weve-updated-the-gov-uk-colours-and-font/).\r\n\r\n[Pull request #1288: Update colour palette](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1288).\r\n\r\n### Check the new version of the font\r\n\r\nThe size and baseline of the Design System's font are now more consistent with other fonts. Text now aligns vertically in text boxes without you needing to adjust it.\r\n\r\nIf you've extended or created components, you should check that your text is still vertically aligned correctly.\r\n\r\nIf you're using GOV.UK Frontend and [GOV.UK Template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template), you can [turn on compatibility mode](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/compatibility.md) to keep using the font from GOV.UK Template.\r\n\r\nPull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#1434: Update font to use v2 of GOV.UK Transport font](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1434)\r\n- [#1441: Removing font style adjustments](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1441)\r\n\r\n### Update links from error summary components to radios and checkboxes\r\n\r\nIf you've linked from an error summary component to the first input in a [radios](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/radios/) or [checkboxes](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/checkboxes/) component, the link will no longer work.\r\n\r\nThis is because the `id` of the first input no longer has the suffix `-1`.\r\n\r\nIf there are links back to radios or checkboxes components in your error summary component, remove `-1` from the end of the `href` attribute.\r\n\r\n[Pull request #1426: Make radios and checkboxes components easier to link to from error summary](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1426)\r\n\r\n### Update the markup for tabs\r\n\r\nYou do not need to do anything if you're using Nunjucks macros.\r\n\r\nIf you are not using Nunjucks macros, remove the `govuk-tabs__tab--selected` class from the first tab's link, then add the `govuk-tabs__list-item--selected` class to that link's parent list item.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<li class=\"govuk-tabs__list-item govuk-tabs__list-item--selected\">\r\n  <a class=\"govuk-tabs__tab\" href=\"#tab1\">\r\n    Tab 1\r\n  </a>\r\n</li>\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Pull request #1496: Update the focus state for tabs](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1443)\r\n\r\n### Update start button icon\r\n\r\n[Start buttons](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/#start-buttons) have a new icon. Your start buttons will lose their current icons unless you replace the old icon with the new one.\r\n\r\nIf you're using Nunjucks:\r\n\r\n- set the `isStartButton` option to `true`\r\n- remove the `.govuk-button--start` class\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ngovukButton({\r\n  text: \"Start now\",\r\n  href: \"#\",\r\n  isStartButton: true\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're using HTML, add the SVG code from the [start button example in the Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/button/#start-buttons).\r\n\r\n[Pull request #1341: Add new start button icon](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1341)\r\n\r\n### Adjust text alignment in tables\r\n\r\nText now aligns to the top of table cells. If you've used a different alignment in a table, you should use your own CSS styles to keep the alignment the same.\r\n\r\nFor example, to align text in the centre:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.app-table--vertical-align-middle .govuk-table__header,\r\n.app-table--vertical-align-middle .govuk-table__cell {\r\n  vertical-align: middle;\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n[Pull request #1345: Set 'vertical-align:top' positioning on table headers and cells](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1345)\r\n\r\n### Replace Sass mixins in grids\r\n\r\nIf you're using the `@govuk-grid-column` Sass mixin to create custom grid classes, you must remove the `$class` parameter.\r\n\r\nIf you're passing a class name, put the mixin inside your selector. For example:\r\n\r\n```scss\r\n.your-class-name {\r\n  @include govuk-grid-column(...)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can no longer use the `govuk-grid-row` mixin. You can replace it with the `.govuk-grid-row` class in your HTML.\r\n\r\nYou must also replace calls to the `grid-width` mixin with calls to the `govuk-grid-width` mixin.\r\n\r\nPull requests:\r\n\r\n- [#1376: Remove $class param from @govuk-grid-column mixin](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1376)\r\n- [#1342: Remove grid-width mixin](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1342)\r\n- [#1343: Removes govuk-grid-row mixin](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1343)\r\n\r\n### Rename the border width variable\r\n\r\nIf you use Sass and you’ve extended or created components that use the border width variable, rename `$govuk-border-width-mobile` to `$govuk-border-width-narrow`.\r\n\r\n[Pull request #1287: Rename border-width-mobile to reflect how it's used](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1287)\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n### Add attributes to table headings\r\n\r\nYou can now add attributes like classes, rowspan and colspan to table row headers.\r\n\r\n[Pull request #1367: Allow for classes, rowspan, colspan and attributes on row headers](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1367). Thanks to [edwardhorsford](https://github.com/edwardhorsford).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Use page wrapper auto spacing\r\n\r\nYou can now add the `.govuk-main-wrapper--auto-spacing` modifier class to your `<main>` element to add responsive padding to the top and bottom of the page.\r\n\r\nThis will add the correct amount of padding depending on if there are elements above the `<main>` element inside the `govuk-width-container` wrapper. Elements above the `<main>` element could include a back link or breadcrumb component.\r\n\r\nIf you need to control the spacing manually, use the `.govuk-main-wrapper--l` modifier instead.\r\n\r\nThe `govuk-main-wrapper` and `govuk-main-wrapper--l` Sass mixins are now deprecated. [Contact us](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/get-in-touch/) if you need to continue using these mixins.\r\n\r\n[Pull request #1493: Add automatic vertical spacing modifier for main wrapper](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1493)\r\n\r\n### GDS Transport now falls back to Arial in Internet Explorer 8 (IE8)\r\n\r\nIE8 will now use Arial instead of GDS Transport.\r\n\r\nThis is because IE8 requires a very large Embedded Open Type (.eot) font file for external fonts. Arial will take less time to render for IE8 users, who are likely to be on older computers.\r\n\r\n[Pull request #1434: Update font to use v2 of GOV.UK Transport font](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1434).

Considerations for fixed components such as modals\r\n\r\nWe have been made aware that the [change to force scroll bars to appear at all times](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1230) can change the behaviour of some components such as modals.\r\n\r\nIf you're using your own components that rely on the overflow state of the document (such as modals) you should make sure you test those components when updating to this version.\r\n\r\n## 🎉&nbsp;&nbsp; Highlights\r\n\r\nThis release:\r\n\r\n- improves the experience for users using phones with non‑rectangular displays (such as those with notches)\r\n- introduces a new button enhancement to try and prevent 'double clicks' firing two click events\r\n- makes error messages more explicit for screen reader users\r\n- fixes an issue where the content 'jumps around' in browsers that resize the viewport when displaying scrollbars\r\n- fixes issues with the summary list and inset text components\r\n- allows you to use the attributes option on inputs within the date input component\r\n\r\nThanks to everyone that contributed to this release.\r\n\r\n## 🆕&nbsp;&nbsp; New features\r\n\r\n### Enable `pattern` attribute for input\r\n\r\n  You can now set the `pattern` attribute on input fields using the component macros:\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  {{ govukInput({\r\n    name: \"example\",\r\n    pattern: \"[0-9]*\"\r\n  }) }}\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  As well as `pattern`, custom attributes can also be added on day/month/year inputs (e.g. `data-example`) shown below:\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  {{ govukDateInput({\r\n    items: [\r\n      {\r\n        pattern: \"[0-9]*\",\r\n        attributes: {\r\n          \"data-example\": \"value\"\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }) }}\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  ([PR #1172](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1172))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prevent horizontal jump as scrollbars appear\r\n\r\n  As content vertical height grows (e.g. autocomplete results appear), browsers may add scroll bars causing the page to jump horizontally in position.\r\n\r\n  To avoid this, re-introduce fix from GOV.UK Template:\r\n  https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/1204\r\n\r\n  ([PR #1230](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1230))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Accommodate camera notches on new devices (iPhone X, Google Pixel 3 etc)\r\n\r\n  On newer devices with \"camera notches\", browsers reserve a safe area in landscape orientation (known as pillarboxing) so content isn't obscured.\r\n\r\n  To avoid this, support has been added for `viewport-fit=cover` as shown here:\r\n  \r\n  https://webkit.org/blog/7929/designing-websites-for-iphone-x/\r\n\r\n  Thanks to @colinrotherham for contributing this feature.\r\n\r\n  ([PR #1176](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1176))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prefix error messages with a visually hidden \"Error:\" to make it clearer to users of assistive technologies\r\n\r\nTo help users of some assistive technologies, like screen readers, the error message component now includes a hidden 'Error:' prefix before the message.\r\n\r\nIf you have error messages written in another language then you'll need to translate the 'Error' prefix.\r\n\r\n  ([PR #1221](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1221))\r\n\r\n\r\n### Prevent accidental multiple submissions of forms\r\n\r\n  If a user double clicks a submit button in a form, we debounce this event and ignore the second click.\r\n\r\n  HTML data attribute:\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  <button class=\"govuk-button\" data-prevent-double-click=\"true\">\r\n    Submit\r\n  </button>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Nunjucks macro:\r\n\r\n  ```js\r\n  {{ govukButton({\r\n    text: \"Submit\",\r\n    preventDoubleClick: true\r\n  }) }}\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Thanks to @quis  for contributing this feature.\r\n\r\n  ([PR #1018](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/1018))\r\n\r\n\r\n## 🔧&nbsp;&nbsp; Fixes\r\n\r\n### Ensure that files within the core, objects and overrides layers can be imported individually\r\n\r\n  Unlike components, the files within these layers did not previously import their dependencies (for example, most of them require the govuk-exports mixin but did not import it).\r\n\r\n  We've also added tests to ensure that files within these layers can be imported and rendered to CSS without erroring, which should catch this in the future.\r\n\r\n  Thanks to [Alasdair McLeay](https://github.com/penx) for originally raising a PR to fix this.\r\n\r\n  ([PR

`autocomplete` attribute on input, date input and textarea components using the component macros.\r\n\r\n  This was already possible to do with the `attributes` option but this change highlights the new WCAG 2.1 success criteria [Identify Input Purpose](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/identify-input-purpose.html) which \"is to ensure that the purpose of a form input collecting information about the user can be programmatically determined, so that user agents can extract and present this purpose to users using different modalities\".\r\n\r\n  See

Instead, users need pass explicit classes\r\nfor each field in the `items` object for the desired width of the input field.\r\n\r\nIf you are not passing `items` at all, you will get the default items which include these classes.\r\n\r\nIf you are using the Nunjucks macro, you need to provide a width class for\r\neach item, for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{{ govukDateInput({\r\n\"id\": \"dob\",\r\n\"name\": \"dob\",\r\n\"fieldset\": {\r\n    \"legend\": {\r\n    \"text\": \"What is your date of birth?\"\r\n    }\r\n},\r\n\"items\": [\r\n    {\r\n    \"name\": \"day\",\r\n    \"classes\": \"govuk-input--width-2\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n    \"name\": \"month\",\r\n    \"classes\": \"govuk-input--width-2\"\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n    \"name\": \"year\",\r\n    \"classes\": \"govuk-input--width-4\"\r\n    }\r\n]\r\n}) }}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using plain HTML, you need to manually add a width-based class, such\r\nas  `govuk-input--width-2` or `govuk-input--width-4` to the input fields.\r\n\r\n([PR #969](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/969))\r\n\r\n#### Rename `name` argument of date-input component to `namePrefix`.\r\n\r\nThis is better reflective of the purpose of the argument, which is to prefix the `name` attribute of `items`. This is consistent with other components which use the name `idPrefix` to explain similar functionality.\r\n\r\nIf your project currently uses this optional argument with the date-input macro, you need to rename all instances of it to `namePrefix` (NB: this argument shouldn't be confused with the `items.{}.name` attribute which hasn't changed.)\r\n\r\n([PR #984](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/984))\r\n\r\n#### Turn off [compatibility mode](./docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md#compatibility-mode) by default for [GOV.UK Elements](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements), [GOV.UK Template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template), [GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit)\r\n\r\nYou do not need to make any changes if you do not use these projects alongside GOV.UK Frontend.\r\n\r\nTo migrate include the SCSS variables that correspond with the projects you depend on before importing GOV.UK Frontend styles into your app:\r\n\r\n```SCSS\r\n// application.scss\r\n$govuk-compatibility-govukfrontendtoolkit: true;\r\n$govuk-compatibility-govuktemplate: true;\r\n$govuk-compatibility-govukelements: true;\r\n@import \"govuk-frontend/all\";\r\n```\r\n([PR #981](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/981))\r\n\r\n#### Turn on relative typography (rem) by default\r\n\r\nThis allows for end-users to adjust GOV.UK Frontend components by setting their font size in their browser.\r\n\r\nIf you are using GOV.UK Frontend on with no other frameworks this should not break your project.\r\n\r\nIf you need to change this setting for compatibility with [GOV.UK Elements](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_elements), [GOV.UK Template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_template), [GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit) consider enabling [compatibility mode](./docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md#compatibility-mode).\r\n\r\nOtherwise, set `$govuk-typography-use-rem` to `false` before importing GOV.UK Frontend styles into your app:\r\n```SCSS\r\n// application.scss\r\n$govuk-typography-use-rem: false;\r\n@import \"govuk-frontend/all\";\r\n```\r\n([PR #981](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/981))\r\n\r\n#### Remove anchor styling in govuk-lists\r\n\r\nThis was an undocumented feature of lists.\r\n\r\nTo migrate we recommend using adding `.govuk-link` class to any anchors within a govuk-list.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to replicate this functionality without adding a class you can also enable [global styles](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/blob/master/docs/installation/installing-with-npm.md#global-styles) (Note: global styles are enabled by default in the GOV.UK Prototype Kit)\r\n\r\n([PR #985](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/985))\r\n\r\n#### Remove the width declaration from the `<select>` component\r\n\r\nThe `<select>` component’s width will now be defined by it’s content. This addresses some accessibility issues with the select being 100% wide by default. If you want to style your select to be 100% wide we have added a new override class `.govuk-!-width-full` to allow this.\r\n\r\n([PR #960](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/960))\r\n\r\n#### Use text colour on focus for better contrast\r\n\r\nUpdates the focus styles of links in GOV.UK Frontend so they pass WCAG contrast requirements.\r\n\r\n([PR #982](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/982))\r\n\r\n### 🆕 New features\r\n\r\n#### Add a new width override class `.govuk-!-width-full`\r\n\r\nYou can now override elements that have an undefined or smaller percentage  width to be 100% width of their container.\r\n\r\n([PR #960](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/960))\r\n\r\n#### Allow attributes on select items\r\n\r\nYou can now provide attributes on select items\r\n`attributes: { 'data-attribute': 'value' }`\r\n\r\n([PR #977](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/977))\r\n\r\n### 🔧 Fixes\r\n\r\n#### Textareas can now only be resized vertically, to prevent them being resized\r\noutside of their container bounds.

hint object (or add in html) to each radio\r\n  and checkbox item to display the hint\r\n  ([PR #846](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/846))\r\n\r\n- Allow additional classes to be

Fixes:\r\n\r\n- Replace conflicting `js-hidden` class used within the tabs component with a new modifier class.\r\n  Because this class is defined and used within the JavaScript, no markup changes are required.\r\n  ([PR #916](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/916))\r\n- Use `get-function` when calling a Sass function as passing a string to `call()``\r\n  is deprecated and will be illegal in Sass 4.0\r\n  ([PR #919](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/919))\r\n\r\n- Fix flash of unstyled content with conditional reveals (Radios and Checkboxes)\r\n\r\n  If the conditional reveal JavaScript is slow to execute it can result in showing the user their contents briefly which can be jarring.\r\n\r\n  ([PR

release is a feature release, which means that it introduces new features, but there are no breaking changes.\r\n\r\n## Things to be aware of\r\n\r\nThis release includes support for defining font sizes with 'rem', which is disabled by default. This will allow the text in your services to scale appropriately when end-users change the font size in their browser. We intend to [enable this by default](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/868) in a future breaking release.\r\n\r\nWe have updated the panel component so that the heading level can be customised. The default remains an `h2`, but we [will change the default to `h1` in a future breaking release](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/864). If the panel title is also the title of the page, you should update your use of this component now to use an `h1` – if you're using the macro, you can do this by passing `headingLevel: 1`.\r\n\r\nWe have fixed a typo in the `govuk-visually-hidden-focussable` class name. The misspelt classname is still available, but we will [remove it in a future breaking release](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/894). You may want to replace any instances of `govuk-visually-hidden-focussable` in your code with `govuk-visually-hidden-focusable` now to make it easier to upgrade in the future.\r\n\r\nWe have also removed component examples (for example `button.njk`) that were used internally and published to npm, please use the 'yaml' component files instead.\r\n\r\nFinally thanks to @bevanloon for fixing an issue in the footer component!\r\n\r\n## Change log\r\n\r\n🆕 New features:\r\n\r\n- Add `govuk-visually-hidden-focusable` class\r\n\r\n  Adds `.govuk-visually-hidden-focusable` and deprecates `.govuk-visually-hidden-focussable` in order to fix the typo in the class name. Please consider updating your code as the next major release will remove the deprecated class.\r\n\r\n  ([PR #859](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/859))\r\n\r\n- Allow panel component title heading to be customisable.\r\n\r\n  You can now specify a heading level by providing\r\n  `headingLevel: <number>` parameter. Default is `2`.\r\n  ([PR #853](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/853))\r\n\r\n- Update date input component  \r\n\r\n  Allow the `name` and `id` attributes to be passed individually for each input item.\r\n\r\n  Rely on `classes` instead of item names to set the width of input items.\r\n\r\n  Add default (day, month, year) date input items if no items are being specified\r\n\r\n  ([PR #857](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/857))\r\n\r\n- The typography scale can now be converted from pixels to rem automatically,\r\n  with pixels also being provided as a fallback for older browsers.\r\n\r\n  This feature is disabled by default - in order to use it you will need to set\r\n  `$govuk-typography-use-rem: true` and ensure that `$govuk-root-font-size` is\r\n  set to the effective size of your root (html) element. For new projects, this\r\n  should be the default of 16px so you don't have to do anything. For projects\r\n  that use alphagov/govuk_template this should be 10px.\r\n\r\n  The intention is to enable this by default in the next major version:\r\n  https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/issues/868\r\n\r\n  ([PR #858](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/858))\r\n\r\n\r\n🔧 Fixes:\r\n\r\n- Remove mistakenly applied 5px bottom margin from radio and checkbox\r\n  labels.\r\n  ([PR #883](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/883))\r\n\r\n- Apply `display:block` to `.govuk-main-wrapper`\r\n\r\n  In IE11 `main` element is set to `display:inline` so padding\r\n  and margins aren't applied.\r\n  ([PR #863](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/863)))\r\n\r\n- Line-heights are now converted from pixels to relative 'unit-less' values\r\n  in order to prevent issues when resizing text in the browser.\r\n  ([PR #837](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/837) and\r\n   [PR #848](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/848))\r\n\r\n- Add bottom margin to Tabs component\r\n  All components (or outer layer components) have a bottom margin\r\n  applied to them so spacing feels automatic.\r\n  ([PR #841](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/841))\r\n\r\n- Update Crown copyright link\r\n  Update the Crown copyright link on the National Archives so\r\n  we don't send users on an unnecessary redirect.\r\n  ([PR #824](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/824))\r\n\r\n- Fixes radio and checkbox labels extending full width of page\r\n  ([PR #821](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/821))\r\n\r\n- Prevent the exclamation mark in the warning text component from being\r\n  selectable, which also excludes it when it is copied as part of a wider body\r\n  of text\r\n  ([PR #856](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/856))\r\n\r\n- Add customised colours handling for warning text\r\n\r\n  By adding a border to this component, when a user customises their colour settings\r\n  they will still see a circle even if the background is removed.\r\n  ([PR #852](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/852))\r\n\r\n- Fixes a bug where the phase banner incorrectly uses a font-size of 19px when\r\n  global styles are enabled\r\n  ([PR #877](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/877))\r\n\r\n- Add outlines to Radios and Checkboxes for customised colour users\r\n\r\n  Now when a [user customises their colours](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/how-users-change-colours-on-websites/),\r\n  they should see a focus state on both Radios and Checkboxes.\r\n  ([PR #854](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/854))\r\n\r\n- Add outline to tag for customised colour users\r\n\r\n  Now when a [user customises their colours](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/how-users-change-colours-on-websites/),\r\n  the tag component still keeps it's meaning.\r\n  ([PR #855](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/855))\r\n\r\n- Define size of table in `px` rather than `em`\r\n\r\n  This brings the styling of tables inline with rest of GOV.UK Frontend which no longer uses `em` for measurements.\r\n\r\n  This change very slightly increases the padding of table cells on mobile viewport as the use of `em` meant the font size set in the table was used to calculate padding. `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` of cells increase by 1.5px respectively which very slightly increases the height of the table on mobile.\r\n\r\n  In the unlikely case that your UI has a dependency on tables being a certain fixed height of mobile viewport, this change might affect you.\r\n\r\n  ([PR #845](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/845))\r\n\r\n- Fix header component's reliance on markup whitespace\r\n\r\n  We have had issues where the header component can render incorrectly if the markup contains whitespace,\r\n  for example if it has been pretty printed.\r\n\r\n  This changes the header component to use float based columns similar to how the grid system works.\r\n\r\n  ([PR #884](httqps://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/884))\r\n\r\n🏠 Internal:\r\n\r\n- Fix Design System url in package READMEs and review app\r\n  ([PR #812](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/812))\r\n\r\n- Update back-link example to show default usage doesn't need\r\n  `text` parameter\r\n  ([PR #819](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/819))\r\n\r\n- Lowercase component names\r\n  ([PR #822](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/822))\r\n\r\n- Tidy up some package.json fields to help contributors and users\r\n  ([PR #827](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/827))\r\n\r\n- Fix failing Heroku app with Node 10.5.0\r\n  Revert to pinning node version in package json\r\n  ([PR #833](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/833))\r\n\r\n- Format YAML and Nunjucks consistently\r\n  ([PR

release doesn't require a password and is published under a new package name `govuk-frontend` (instead of `@govuk-frontend/frontend`). This package name will be the one used for the upcoming v1.0.0 \r\n\r\nThe majority of breaking changes in this release are to do with consistency and robustness of the public API in GOV.UK Frontend. Please see Changelog for details.\r\n\r\n# Changelog\r\n\r\n## 0.0.32 (Breaking release)\r\n\r\n**This release changes the name of package.** It's now published as `govuk-frontend` on `npm`.\r\n\r\nTo migrate to the new page start by doing the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nnpm remove @govuk-frontend/frontend\r\nnpm install --save govuk-frontend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen replace any instances of `@govuk-frontend/frontend` with `govuk-frontend` in your codebase.\r\n\r\n💥 Breaking changes:\r\n\r\n- The default build of the GOV.UK Frontend JavaScript now does not initialize all components automatically.\r\n\r\n  This allows you to initialize only the components you need, and gives you finer control over when the JavaScript for GOV.UK Frontend runs.\r\n\r\n  To migrate your project you need to change\r\n  ```html\r\n    <script src=\"{path-to-govuk-frontend}/all.js\"></script>\r\n  ```\r\n  to\r\n  ```html\r\n    <script src=\"{path-to-govuk-frontend}/all.js\"></script>\r\n    <script>window.GOVUKFrontend.initAll()</script>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Now, if you only want to initialize a specific component you can now do so by:\r\n  ```html\r\n    <script src=\"{path-to-govuk-frontend}/all.js\"></script>\r\n    <script>\r\n      var Button = window.GOVUKFrontend.Button\r\n      new Button(document).init()\r\n    </script>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Note: If you are importing JavaScript with a bundler, this is not likely to change anything for you.\r\n  ([PR #759](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/759))\r\n\r\n- Consistently structure the Details and Button component, so that they can be instantiated the same as the other components.\r\n\r\n  If you're using `GOVUKFrontend.initAll()` you do not need to make any changes, otherwise you need to change\r\n  ```html\r\n    <script>\r\n      new Button().init()\r\n      new Details().init()\r\n    </script>\r\n  ```\r\n  to\r\n  ```html\r\n    <script>\r\n      new Button(document).init()\r\n\r\n      var $details = document.querySelectorAll('details')\r\n      nodeListForEach($details, function ($detail) {\r\n        new Details($detail).init()\r\n      })\r\n    </script>\r\n  ```\r\n  ([PR #761](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/761))\r\n\r\n- All sass-mq settings have now been made private. We are now exposing new\r\n  settings to allow you to customise breakpoints and responsive behaviour:\r\n\r\n  - `$govuk-breakpoints` - Map of breakpoint definitions\r\n  - `$govuk-show-breakpoints` - Whether to show the current breakpoint in the\r\n    top right corner\r\n  - `$govuk-ie8-breakpoint` - Breakpoint to rasterize to for IE8\r\n\r\n  If you are overriding any settings prefixed with `$mq-` in your application\r\n  you will need to update to the use the new `$govuk-` prefixed settings.\r\n\r\n  ([PR #748](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/748))\r\n\r\n- Font settings have been renamed:\r\n\r\n  - `$govuk-font-stack` has been renamed to `$govuk-font-family`\r\n  - `$govuk-font-stack-tabular` has been renamed to `$govuk-font-family-tabular`\r\n  - `$govuk-font-stack-print` has been renamed to `$govuk-font-family-print`\r\n\r\n  ([PR #748](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/748))\r\n\r\n- Spacing has been refactored. You will need to update Sass that currently uses GOV.UK Frontend spacing:\r\n\r\n  - Instead of\r\n  ``` css\r\n  $govuk-spacing-scale-*\r\n  ```\r\n  use\r\n  ``` css\r\n  govuk-spacing(*)\r\n  ```\r\n  where `*` is the number on the spacing scale. The scale itself has remained the same so that `$govuk-spacing-scale-3` corresponds to `govuk-spacing(3)`. This change allows us to control the error messaging when incorrect values are used and to deprecate variables. The values of spacing variables can also be overridden by consumers.\r\n\r\n  - Instead of:\r\n  ``` css\r\n  @include govuk-responsive-margin($govuk-spacing-responsive-2, \"bottom\");\r\n  @include govuk-responsive-padding($govuk-spacing-responsive-2, \"bottom\");\r\n  ```\r\n  use\r\n  ``` css\r\n  @include govuk-responsive-margin(2, \"bottom\");\r\n  @include govuk-responsive-padding(2, \"bottom\");\r\n  ```\r\n  This change, again, allows us to control the error messaging since spacing variables are not exposed directly. Also, the spacing scale itself has not changed so that `$govuk-spacing-responsive-2` corresponds to `2` when passed to the padding and margin mixins.\r\n\r\n  This PR also updates tests and sass-docs of spacing variables and helpers.\r\n\r\n  Additionally, this PR hardcodes the value of `$govuk-gutter`, see PR for more details.\r\n\r\n  ([PR #779](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/779))\r\n\r\n- Remove `pageStart` block from template, as could result in rendering issues in older IE.\r\n  ([PR #765](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/765))\r\n\r\n- You should no longer call the `mq` mixin directly - you should replace any\r\n  calls to it from your own code with `govuk-media-query` which accepts the same\r\n  arguments. All mixins and settings that start with `mq-` should be considered\r\n  private – they could be removed in the future without notice.\r\n  ([PR #763](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/763))\r\n\r\n- All of the shorthand 'font' mixins (e.g. `govuk-font-bold-80`,\r\n  `govuk-font-regular-tabular-19`), have been removed and replaced with calls to\r\n  a new mixin `govuk-font`. If you are using these mixins in your application\r\n  you will need to update your code to call `govuk-font` instead.\r\n  \r\n  ([PR #772](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/772))\r\n\r\n- The font maps are no longer as individual variables (e.g. `$govuk-font-80`) -\r\n  they are all now part of one single `$govuk-typography-scale` map. Instead of\r\n  passing font maps to `govuk-typography-responsive` you should now pass the\r\n  desktop font size (e.g. `govuk-typography-responsive(80)` or\r\n  `govuk-typography-responsive($size: 80)`.\r\n\r\n  ([PR #772](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/772))\r\n\r\n- All organisation variables (e.g. `$govuk-cabinet-office`) have been moved into\r\n  a single `$govuk-colours-organisations` map. If you need to use an\r\n  organisation colour in your own code, you should use the new\r\n  `govuk-organisation-colour` function:\r\n\r\n  ```scss\r\n  .element {\r\n    color: govuk-organisation-colour(cabinet-office);\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Note that this function will return 'web-safe' colours by default. You can\r\n  pass $websafe: false to get the non-websafe colour.\r\n\r\n- The colour palette variables (e.g. `$govuk-green`) have been moved into a\r\n  new single `$govuk-colours` map. If you need to reference a colour within your\r\n  application you should use the new `govuk-colour` function:\r\n\r\n  ```scss\r\n  .element {\r\n    color: govuk-colour(\"green\");\r\n  }\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  Tints (`$govuk-green-50`, `$govuk-green-25`) have been removed from the colour\r\n  palette.\r\n\r\n- A number of the colours have been renamed to use more neutral names:\r\n\r\n  - `mauve` → `light-purple`\r\n  - `fuchsia` → `bright-purple`\r\n  - `baby-pink` → `light-pink`\r\n  - `mellow-red` → `bright-red`\r\n  - `grass-green` → `light-green`\r\n\r\n- The 'circle shape' object (`.govuk-circle`) which was used by the warning text\r\n  component's '!' icon has been removed and the `govuk-warning-text__icon` class\r\n  has been updated to make it circular without the need for another class.\r\n\r\n  ([PR #782](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/782))\r\n- Removal of `govuk-prose-scope`\r\n  We don't have confidence that the prose scope is well understood – \r\n  without further research / better documentation it's safer to remove it for now.\r\n  \r\n  If you are currently using prose-scope, you should revert to applying classes to \r\n  individual headings, lists and hr elements.\r\n  In version [0.0.29-alpha](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/releases/tag/v0.0.29-alpha) \r\n  release we have added the option to enable global link and paragraph styles. \r\n  \r\n  If you're using a recent version of the Private Beta Prototype kit, \r\n  this is enabled by default.\r\n\r\n  ([PR #778](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/778))\r\n\r\n- Make override classes consistently verbose\r\n  Based on [feedback from the community](https://gist.github.com/nickcolley/f135e89ed4b679355b0ab47135b38ee8)\r\n  we have made the override classes consistent where previously some where verbose and some where shorthand.\r\n\r\n  We've made the decision to remove the 'r' for responsive, this was hard to remember and users found this confusing.\r\n\r\n  To migrate you will need to replace any instances of:\r\n\r\n  - `.govuk-!-f-{size}` with `.govuk-!-font-size-{size}`\r\n  - `.govuk-!-w-{weight}` with `.govuk-!-font-weight-{weight}`\r\n  - `.govuk-!-m{direction}-r{scale}` with `.govuk-!-margin-{direction}-{scale}`\r\n  - `.govuk-!-p{direction}-r{scale}` with `.govuk-!-padding-{direction}-{scale}`\r\n\r\n  For example if you were using:\r\n  - `.govuk-!-mb-r5` you would need to change this to `.govuk-!-margin-bottom-5`\r\n  - `.govuk-!-f-24` you would need to change this to `.govuk-!-font-size-24`\r\n\r\n  See the original Pull Request for the full list of classes before and after.\r\n\r\n  ([PR #786](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/786))\r\n\r\n🔧 Fixes:\r\n\r\n- Fix govuk-equilateral-height function usage in shape-arrow helper\r\n  ([PR ##766](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/766))\r\n\r\n- The `<label>` element will now be omitted for form controls where no label\r\n  text or html is provided. If you call the label component directly whilst\r\n  passing neither text nor html, no HTML will be outputted.\r\n  ([PR #740](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/740))\r\n\r\n- Add `govuk-main-wrapper` to `<main>` element by default.\r\n  ([PR #742](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/742))\r\n\r\n- Use relative imports whenever a component imports another component, to allow\r\n  for cases where users don't want to add the components folder itself to their\r\n  nunjucks paths.\r\n  ([PR #743](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/743))\r\n\r\n- Update JavaScript global namespace from 'all' to 'GOVUKFrontend',\r\n  we intend to allow users to initialize components from this namespace.\r\n  ([PR #747](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/747))\r\n\r\n- Tabular numbers will now correctly use the `$govuk-font-family-tabular`\r\n  setting rather than being hardcoded to use NTA tabular.\r\n  ([PR #748](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/748))\r\n\r\n- Prevents focus from being lost to the inline SVGs in the header (the crown)\r\n  and footer (the OGL logo) by marking them as non-focusable elements\r\n  ([PR #774](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/774))\r\n\r\n- Use the correct class name in bold label example \r\n  (govuk-label--s rather than govuk-label--bold)\r\n  ([PR #784](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/784))\r\n  \r\n- Update table of arguments for each component to ensure they're accurate.\r\n  ([PR #769](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/769))\r\n\r\n- Add explicit dependency on colour maps\r\n  ([PR #790](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/790))\r\n\r\n🆕 New features:\r\n\r\n- Components are now available to use from the `GOVUKFrontend` global.\r\nYou can now initialize individual components like so:\r\n```html\r\n  <script>\r\n    var Radios = window.GOVUKFrontend.Radios\r\n    new Radios(document).init()\r\n  </script>\r\n```\r\n([PR #759](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/759))\r\n\r\n- Add `beforeContent` block to the template, for content that does not belong inside `<main>` element.\r\n  For example: Back links.\r\n  ([PR #742](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/742))\r\n\r\n- Most of the settings, helpers and tools layers is now documented using\r\n  Sassdoc, with variables, functions and mixins being marked as private or\r\n  public.\r\n  ([PR #748](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/748))\r\n  ([PR #762](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/762))\r\n\r\n- Most of the settings can now be overridden in your

The\r\n  file-upload, input, select and textarea components have been updated to use the\r\n  new Hint component.\r\n\r\n  For example, this example macro call for a File Upload component:\r\n\r\n  ```njk\r\n  {{ govukFileUpload({\r\n    \"id\": \"file-upload\",\r\n    \"name\": \"photo\",\r\n    \"label\": {\r\n      \"text\": \"Upload your photo\",\r\n      \"hintText\": \"Your photo may be in your Pictures, Photos, Downloads or Desktop folder.\"\r\n    }\r\n  }) }}\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  would now be:\r\n\r\n  ```njk\r\n  {{ govukFileUpload({\r\n    \"id\": \"file-upload\",\r\n    \"name\": \"photo\",\r\n    \"label\": {\r\n      \"text\": \"Upload your photo\"\r\n    },\r\n    \"hint\": {\r\n      \"text\": \"Your photo may be in your Pictures, Photos, Downloads or Desktop folder.\"\r\n    }\r\n  }) }}\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  For more examples of the new markup and Nunjucks macros see the GOV.UK Design System [Question Pages pattern](https://govuk-design-system-production.cloudapps.digital/patterns/question-pages/)\r\n\r\n  ([PR #681](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/681))\r\n\r\n- The date-input component now sets an explicit `group` role on the fieldset\r\n  to force JAWS 18 to announce the error message and hint.\r\n  ([PR #681](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/681))\r\n\r\n- The label component macro now accepts an `isPageHeading` argument which determines\r\n  whether the label itself should be wrapped in an h1:\r\n\r\n  ```html\r\n  <h1 class=\"govuk-label-wrapper\">\r\n    <label class=\"govuk-label\">What is your National Insurance number?</label>\r\n  </h1>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  The `.govuk-label-wrapper` removes the margins from the heading so that the\r\n  presence of the `h1` has no effect on the styling of the label.\r\n\r\n  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))\r\n\r\n\r\n- Added new modifier classes for labels to allow you to create a label that\r\n  visually corresponds to the equivalent heading class (for example, a\r\n  `.govuk-label--xl` will have the same font size and weight as a\r\n  `.govuk-heading-xl`)\r\n\r\n  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))\r\n\r\n\r\n- The arguments for a fieldset's legend have been rolled up into an object.

0.0.24-alpha (Breaking release)\r\n\r\nBreaking changes:\r\n\r\n- Namespace existing mixins and functions ( PR [#557](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/557))\r\n- The class `.govuk-section-break__visible` has been renamed to\r\n  `.govuk-section-break--visible` as it is a modifier, not an element.\r\n  (PR [#547](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/547))\r\n- Simplify `src/` folder structure, remove tree and string manipulations from\r\ngulp tasks (PR [#545](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/545))\r\n\r\nNew features:\r\n\r\n- A new variable `$govuk-input-border-colour` has been introduced to define the\r\n  border colour for inputs. The Input, Select and Textarea components have been\r\n  updated to use it.\r\n  (PR [#551](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/551))\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n- Removes media query display on body from compiled CSS\r\n  (PR [#560](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/560))\r\n\r\n- Fieldset legends now correctly use 'full black' text colour when printed\r\n  (PR [#544](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/544))\r\n- Radio and Checkbox components now explicitly use currentColor for their\r\n  borders, rather than relying on inheriting it\r\n  (PR [#551](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/551))\r\n\r\nInternal:\r\n\r\n- The 'prose scope' has been updated to extend only placeholder classes. The\r\n  corresponding classes the prose scope extends have been updated to provide a\r\n  placeholder class and separately create the concrete class. This allows us\r\n  to be specific about which occurrences of the class are meant to be extended.\r\n  (PR [#550](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/550))\r\n- The sass-lint config has been updated to prevent the use of `@extend` with\r\n  concrete classes.\r\n  (PR [#550](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/550))\r\n- Release process has been streamlined with fewer steps\r\n  (PR [#553](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/553))\r\n- Update `govuk-section-break__visible` new class name `govuk-section-break--visible` in the     review app's Typography page. \r\n  (PR [#566](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/566))"}]
